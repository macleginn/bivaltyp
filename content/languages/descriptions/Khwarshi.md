## Grammar notes
### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction
In Khwarshi, both case marking and argument indexing on the verb display the ergative-absolutive alignment. In the basic transitive construction, the A-argument is in the ergative case, and the P-argument, in the (unmarked) absolutive case. The P-argument also controls the agreement with the verb. The ergative form of nouns coincides with the oblique stem found in other cases. It is mostly marked with suffixes, but there are also instances when the ergative differs from the absolutive only in stress pattern. The stress is not shown graphically in the examples below, however, this particular suprasegmental pattern is marked as \ERG in the gloss. The neutral word order is S(O)V. An example of the transitive construction can be found in (1). 

```
(1)  šamil-i  l-ica-χ-χa           k'ant'a
     PN-ERG   IV-break-CAUS-PST.W  stick(IV)
     ‘Shamil broke a stick.’
```

Non-core arguments are flagged by oblique case markers or, rarely, by postpositions (in combination with one of the two genitives or one of the locative cases).

### Case system
There are 6 non-locative cases: absolutive, ergative, dative, two genitives and causal. The choice between the genitives depends on the syntactic head: the first genitive (GEN1) is used with an absolutive nominal head, whilst the second genitive (GEN2) is used with oblique heads and postpositions. Verbs rarely take a noun in the genitive case as an argument. There are four more non-locative cases (namely, similative, comitative, vocative and temporal), but their position in the overall case system is disputable, since the first two seem to be marked by clitics and are apparently compatible with other cases, and the later two are not productive forms with case functions. The system of locative cases consists of two layers: 6 localizations (IN ‘inside (a container)’, INTER ‘between, in a substance’, SUB ‘under’, AD ‘at, near’, SUPER ‘on the horizontal surface or above it’ and CONT ‘on the vertical surface, in contact with’) and 6 directionals (the unmarked essive, lative, elative, directive, terminative and translative), which yields 36 combinations. Locative cases have extended non-locative functions.

## Verb lemmas
Verbs are cited by the infinitive form with second class agreement marker in form of *j/* if the verb has a slot for it. For example ‘to break’ is cited as *j/icaχa*, whereas the corresponding form in (1) has a different class marker and is in past witnessed form, yielding *licaχχa*.
