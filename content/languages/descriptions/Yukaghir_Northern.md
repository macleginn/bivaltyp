## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

The basic word order of Northern Yukaghir is SOV; apart from the true verbal sentences, the subject-predicate order is also observed in sentences denoting quality or quantity.
Simplifying somewhat, the basic alignment of Northern Yukaghir is nominative-accusative: the A and S arguments (subjects) are in the nominative case and trigger verb agreement, while O arguments (direct objects) can be marked for the accusative case and do not trigger verb agreement. However, the clausal syntax is further complicated by i) differential object marking, whereby direct object can lack the accusative suffix for a variety of reasons and, most notably, ii) a very complex focus-marking systems that affects both case marking on nouns and verbal morphology. Patterns with predicate focus (1), subject focus (2) and object focus (3) are exemplified below.

```

(1)  adu-ŋ   ködǝ  nimǝ-ɣаnǝ  mǝr  wiǝ-m
     VIS-AT  man   house-ACC  AFF  make-TR.3SG
     ‘This man built (focused) a house.’

(2)  mit       abučiǝ       joj-а̄-l
     1PL.POSS  grandmother  be_ill-INCH-SF
     ‘My grandmother (focused) got ill.’

(3)  adu-ŋ  ködǝ  nimǝ-lǝ-ŋ     wiǝ-mǝ-lǝ
     VS-AT  man   house-ACC-FC  make-TR-OF.3SG
     ‘This man built a house (focused).’

```

### Case system

The case system encompasses 11 forms, exemplified below in Table 1 for the noun *ilə* ‘reindeer’. Note that there is a good deal of allomorphy, so that the actual case suffixes in the questionnaire sentences below might look different from the ones shown in Table 1.

## Verb lemmas

Verbs are shown in the form of pure stem without anz inflections. Note that due to various morphonological processes, the stem as used in the inflected forms can be different from the pure stems shown as citation forms.
