The data were gathered in 2022 in Nogliki, the Sakhalin oblast, Russia. All translations were provided by Raisa Maksimovna Talina, a speaker of the East Sakhalin dialect of Nivkh. The Russian version of the questionnaire was used for elicitation.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Nivkh shows the nominative-accusative alignment. In the basic transitive construction, the canonical word order is SOV, and subject and direct object are unmarked. A direct object together with the head verb form a bound complex (in the glosses, the nominal and verbal parts of bound complexes are separated by “+”). Under certain morphophonological conditions, verbs in the bound complex show initial-consonant alternations triggered by the final segment of the preceding noun. In Raisa Maksimovna Talina’s idiolect, however, initial-consonant alternations are optional, cf. (1), so not all expected alternations occur in the gathered data.

```

(1)  a.  ɲi  cʰaχ   +  ta-d
         I   water  +  drink-IND
         ‘I am drinking water.’ (with the consonant alternation)
     
     b.  ɲi  cʰaχ   ra-d
         I   water  drink-IND
         ‘I am drinking water.’ (without the consonant alternation)

```

A direct object can be substituted by the pronominal prefix on the verb (2). In the data, the morphophonologically restricted prefix j- 3SG sometimes occurs on the verb when the direct object does not form a bound complex with the head.

```

(2)  ɲi  j-idə-d
     I   3SG-see-IND
     ‘I saw him/her.’

```
