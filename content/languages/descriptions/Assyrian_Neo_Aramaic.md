"Assyrian Neo-Aramaic" is a conventional label for Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA) varieties spoken by Christians who identify themselves as "Assyrians". Assyrians' homeland is a large area near the borders of modern (Northwestern) Iran, (Northern) Iraq, (Southeastern) Turkey and (Northeastern) Syria, as represented on the [map]{{ map_view }} . Presently, many Assyrians are dispersed around the world, including several communities in the South Caucasus and in the South of Russia.
The data for this project were gathered from Assyrians living in Urmiya, Krasnodar Krai, Russia. A majority of Assyrians in Urmiya speak the Urmi dialect of NENA, originating from the area near Urmia in modern Iran. Other consultants are descendants of settlers originating from the highlands in the Southeast of modern Turkey. Sentences elicited from the latter group of speakers are marked "Non-Urmi speaker" below. Valency patterns in the Urmi and non-Urmi varieties attested in the village of Urmiya do not exhibit significant differences, but see (Say, in prep.) for details.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction
There is no flagging for subjects (A- and S-arguments) or direct objects (P-arguments). The person, number and sometimes gender of the subject are obligatorily indexed on the verb, while indexing of the direct object is optional (Differential Object Indexing). The choice of indices for subjects and objects depends on tense and aspect, as summarized in Table 1.

Table 1. The choice of subject and object person indices in tense and aspect subsystems

|                    |     Subject                     |     Direct object                       |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|     Present        |     S-suffixes (SS.1F etc.)     |     L-suffixes (LS.1SG etc.)            |
|     Past           |     L-suffixes (LS.1SG etc.)    |     S-suffixes (SS.1F etc.)             |
|     Progressive    |     copulas (1M etc.)           |     Possessive suffixes (P.1SG etc.)    |
|     Resultative    |     copulas (1M etc.)           |     Possessive suffixes (P.1SG etc.)    |

The two variants of the transitive construction — with and without object indexing — are in (1) and (2).

```
(1) brata   ctava   dvəkt-u=la					
    girl(F) book(M) seize.RES.F-P.3M=3F	
    ‘The girl is holding a book.’

(2) brata   dvəkt=əla      ctava
    girl(F) seize.RES.F=3F book(M)
    ‘The girl is holding a book.’

```

Non-core arguments are typically flagged by prepositions. Some non-core arguments have the status represented as "BARE", see (Say, in prep.) for details.

## Case system
There is no morphological case on nouns.

## Verb lemmas
Verbs are shown in the so-called *patəx* form: this is the present tense (PRS) form with the zero-realized 3rd person masculine singular S-suffix and no L-suffix.

## Glossing abbreviations
1, 2, 3 — 1st, 2nd, 3rd person; DEM1, DEM2, DEM3, DEM4 — demonstratives; EXI — existential copula; F — feminine; LS — L-suffix; M — masculine; NEG — negation; O — object; OBL — oblique; P — possessive; PL — plural; PN — person name; PRF — perfect; PROG — progressive; PRON —  pronoun; PRS — present; PST — past; REL — relator; RES — resultative; SS — S-suffix.
