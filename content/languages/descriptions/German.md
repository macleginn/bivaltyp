## Grammar notes

German has V2 order in main clauses and clause-final position of the verb in dependent clauses. The subject usually occupies the initial slot before the verb and precedes the object in pragmatically unmarked situations. German features four cases – nominative, genitive, dative and accusative. Basic transitive constructions involve two noun phrases marked for case: subjects take the nominative and objects, the accusative.

Some predicates in the data take prepositional phrases (PPs) as objects. With the exception of motion verbs, whose object PPs usually feature prepositions with spatial semantics (governing accusative to mark direction and dative to mark location), most collocations of verb + preposition (as constituent of the object PP) are semantically non-predictable lexicalizations / collostructions.

## Verb lemmas

Verbs are shown in the infinitive form (including passive marking for passive constructions).
