The data were gathered in 2023-2024 with the collaboration of Alain Christian Bassène, Sokhna Bao-Diop, El Hadji Dieye, Jean-Léopold Diouf, Kader Gueye and Joseph Jean-François Nunez. The Russian version of the questionnaire was used although French was the language of elicitation and discussion.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction
In Wolof, the basic constituent order in verbal clauses is S V (O) (X) (S = subject, V = verb, O = object, X = oblique). However, when an object or an oblique is focalized (which requires the use of special verb forms, see below), it moves to the clause-initial position. Neither subjects nor objects are flagged, whereas obliques are standardly introduced by prepositions.

The manifestations of the grammatical relation subject (which encompasses the sole argument of semantically monovalent verbs and the agent of prototypical transitive verbs) are the pre-verbal position of the relevant NP and the obligatory indexation on the verb by means of person-number markers. Wolof has several sets of subject indexes depending on the TAM-polarity-focus value expressed by the verb, and some tenses are characterized by portmanteau markers resulting from the fusion of the subject index and another inflectional marker. The subject NP is syntactically optional.

The grammatical relation object (labelled "OBJ" in the dataset below), whose prototype is the patient of prototypical transitive verbs, is characterized by the possibility of expressing objects by means of object indexes attached to the verb. The object indexes express person and number. In contrast to subject indexes, they are not obligatory, and are used only to represent topical objects. They do not vary according to the TAM-polarity-focus value expressed by the verb and never fuse with other elements of the verb form.

Wolof does not have the equivalent of the grammatical relation indirect object (or dative) as found in the languages of Europe. By contrast, double-object constructions are extremely productive. For example, the recipient of the verbs of giving can only be encoded as one of the two objects in a double-object construction. The relative order of T and R is free, at least in the typical cases when the semantic nature of T and R excludes ambiguity. Both T and R can be indexed on the verb by means of the same paradigm of indexes, and both can be indexed at the same time, but the relative order of the indexes is determined by the following hierarchy: 1st/2nd person > 3rd person plural > 3rd person singular. This means that a sentence that is literally ‘I gave-3PL-3SG’ is ambiguous (‘it to them’ or ‘them to him/her’), since indexes do not express gender distinctions.

### Nouns and noun phrases
There is no grammatical case in Wolof. 

Wolof has a gender system historically cognate with those found across the Niger-Congo language family (commonly designated as “noun class systems”), but very atypical in many respects. This system relies on an agreement mechanism in which every noun form has the ability to act as the controller in one of 10 possible agreement patterns (or “classes”). The agreement patterns in which nouns can be involved as controllers are conventionally designated by letters that evoke the phonological form of the agreement markers: B, G, K, J, L, M, Ñ, S, W, Y

The overwhelming majority of Wolof nouns have the same form in the singular and in the plural, and number is only apparent in the class markers attached to several types of noun modifiers, including the definite article, cf. for example *xale b-i* ‘the child’ / *xale y-i* ‘the children’, where *i* is the definiteness marker, and *b* and *y* are the class markers. With nouns belonging to other genders, other pairs of class markers may be involved in the expression of the singular vs. plural distinction, cf. *nit k-i* ‘the person’ / *nit ñ-i* ‘the persons’. In such a system, genders can be defined as sets of nominal lexemes selecting the same pairs of “classes” for their modifiers. For example, *xale* ‘child’ belongs to gender B/Y, whereas *nit* ‘person’ belongs to gender K/Ñ. Babou and Loporcaro (2016)  identify a total of 17 possible class pairings, or genders, most of them including a very limited number of nouns.

Among the ten classes whose selection may depend on a nominal controller, six can only express the number value ‘singular’ (B, G, K, L, M and W), two can only express the number value ‘plural’ (Y and Ñ), and the remaining two (S and J) may express either singular or plural, depending on the other class with which they form a pair.

## Verb inflection and verb lemmas
The verbs used in the dataset below are cited in their bare form.

Wolof has an atypical system of verb inflection, in the sense that most of the inflectional markers attached to verbs cannot be straightforwardly analyzed as prefixes or suffixes. They are rather clitics whose position with respect to the verb stem and the other markers attached to the verb puts into play a complex set or rules.

In addition to subject indexation and object indexation, verb inflection expresses not only TAM and polarity, but also focus, with a distinction between subject focus, object/oblique focus and verb focus (Robert 2000). 

## Glossing abbreviations
APPL — applicative, AUX — auxiliation marker, CAUS —  causative, cl — class (agreement pattern), CPL — completive,  CSTR — construct,  DEF — definite, DIST — distal, EqCOP — equative copula, EXPL — expletive, FocO/X — focalization of an object or of an oblique, FocS — focalization of the subject, FocV — focalization of the verb, FUT — future, IMP — imperative, INCPL — incompletive, INDEF — indefinite, INTERR — interrogative (determiner or pronoun), LOC — locative, MID — middle, NEG — negative, NONDUM —  nondumitive (‘not yet’), NSPS — non-specific subject, oI — object index, PL — plural, PN — proper name, POSS — possessive, PRF — perfect, PROH — prohibitive, PRST — presentative, PST — past, Q — question marker, RECP — reciprocal, REL — relativizer, SG — singular, sI — subject index, SOC — sociative.

B, G, K, J, L, M, Ñ, S, W and Y between parentheses immediately after the lexical gloss of nouns identify their gender, with the following simplification. Given that very few nouns select a class other than Y in the plural, the plural class is only indicated if it is not the default plural class Y. For example, nit is glossed ‘person(K/Ñ), whereas xale, which belongs to gender B/Y, is not glossed ‘child(B/Y)’, but simply ‘child(B)’.
