The data were collected in 2023 using the Russian version of the questionnaire. Aydin Pashayev, pictured above together with Gilles Authier, translated the questionnaire sentences in his capacity of a native speaker.

## Grammaar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Case marking displays the ergative-nominative alignment. In the basic transitive construction, the A-argument is in the ergative, and the P-argument, in the (unmarked) nominative. The ergative form of nouns does not coincide with the oblique stem. The verb takes gender-number prefixes agreeing with the S/P argument in the nominative. These gender-number agreement prefixes can be word-initial but are more often found after deictic preverbs, the reversive and other expressive prefixes, as well as after the negation prefix in some forms. Non-core arguments are flagged by oblique case markers or, rarely, by postpositions (in combination with the genitive case).

### Case system

There are 15 cases: 6 abstract cases and 9 spatial cases.

The abstract cases are nominative, ergative, dative, genitive (this case is signalled two attributive endings agreeing with the gender/number or obliqueness of the head and glossed as "ATTR" below), comitative (= instrumental), and comparative.

Second, there are 9 spatial cases. The system of spatial cases is not transparently layered, but usual Lezgic labels still apply: there are 5 ‘locatives’ merging essive and lative orientations (IN ‘inside’, SUPER ‘on’, AD ‘at, beside’, CONT ‘in contact with’ and APUD ‘at, behind’), three ‘elatives’, (ABL ‘(outside) from’, SUPEREL ‘from on’, CONTEL ‘from in contact with’) and one ‘directive’ DIR.

## Verb lemmas

Verbs are cited by their masdar form, based on the perfective stem, with IV class agreement.
