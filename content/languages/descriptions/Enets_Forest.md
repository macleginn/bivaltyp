Forest Enets is a highly endangered language spoken on the Yenisei river in the Far North of Siberia. Nowadays, there are no more than 20 speakers of Forest Enets, mostly residing in the village of Potapovo and in the town of Dudinka in the Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District of the Krasnoyarsk Krai. Forest Enets is sometimes regarded as one of the two dialects of the Enets language, along with Tundra Enets.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Subjects and direct objects are formally distinguished by dependent marking only under certain conditions.
For the nouns of the default inflectional class without possessive markers, the bare unmarked stem is used both in the subject and in the direct object position.
For the singular nouns of non-default inflectional classes without possessive markers, the oblique stem is optionally used when the noun is in the direct object position (1).

```
(1) kasa-jʔ         tetʃi-za                biz        ixura
    man-NOM.SG.1SG  be_cold(IPFV)-PTCP.SIM  water.OBL  drink(PFV).3SG.S
    ‘My friend drank cold water’.
```

For the nouns marked with the possessive markers, the formal distinguishability of subject and direct object depends on the person and number of the possessor and the number of the possessee. Table 1 gives the Forest Enets possessive markers for the singular possessor used for the nouns in the positions of subject, adnominal/postpositional dependent and direct object. 

Table 1. Case and possessive marking of nouns (singular possessors)
|          |     Singular possessee    |                                           |                      | Non-singular possessee  |                                           |                      |
|----------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|
|          |     Subject               |     Adnominal/postpositional dependent    |     Direct object    |     Subject             |     Adnominal/postpositional dependent    |     Direct object    |
|     1    |     -jʔ, -b               |     -nʲiʔ                                 |     -jʔ, -b          |     -nʲiʔ               |     -nʲiʔ                                 |     -nʲiʔ            |
|     2    |     -r                    |     -d                                    |     -d               |     -z                  |     -t                                    |     -z               |
|     3    |     -za                   |     -da                                   |     -da              |     -za                 |     -ta                                   |     -za              |

Where there is a distinction between the markers used for the subject and for the adnominal/postpositional dependent, the former is glossed as nominative and the latter, as oblique. The direct object is thus marked either with the nominative (2) or with the oblique marker (3). Where the oblique marker is used, as in (3), the subject and the direct object are formally distinct.

```
(2) modʲi  kasa-jʔ         nɛ-jʔ             tɛnee-za
    I      man-NOM.SG.1SG  woman-NOM.SG.1SG  know(IPFV)-3SG.SOsg
    ‘My friend knows my wife’. 

(3) modʲi  kasa-jʔ         nɛ-da             ɔtee
    I      man-NOM.SG.1SG  woman-OBL.SG.3SG  wait(IPFV).3SG.S
    ‘My friend is waiting for his wife’.
```

Personal pronouns have distinct forms of the nominative, the genitive and the accusative cases. The nominative and the accusative forms are used, respectively, in the positions of the subject and the direct object. The genitive form is used with some postpositions.
The subject (always) and the 3rd person direct object (under certain conditions) are indexed on the verb. There are three series of agreement markers, the subject, the subject-object and the middle series. The middle agreement markers are used for subject indexing with some intransitive verbs. The subject agreement markers can be used for subject indexing in both intransitive and transitive clauses (3). The subject-object agreement markers are cumulative suffixes used for indexing the subject and the direct object (2). The choice between the subject and subject-object agreement markers in transitive clauses is primarily determined by the topicality of the direct object (Differential Object Indexing).
Non-core arguments are marked either by locative cases or by postpositions and are never indexed on the verb. Some non-core arguments have the status represented as “TOP”: they are clause-initial (clause-internal) nominative noun phrases that are not indexed on the verb, see (Ovsjannikova 2018; in press).

## Case system
The core case system includes two formally distinct cases for nouns, viz. nominative and oblique, as outlined above, and three cases for pronouns. The locational cases include the dative, the locative, the ablative and the (marginal) prolative cases. Postpositions combine with the nouns in the oblique case.

## Verb lemmas
The verbs are shown in the form of a bare stem.
