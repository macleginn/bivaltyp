The data were gathered in 2024 by Kwadwo Brobbey Nti in his capacity of a native speaker of Twi. In the process of preparing the dataset, we benefited from feedback from Natalia Bogomolova and then Andrey Shluinsky. After this, the data have been substantially reanalyzed based on scholarly consultations by Anna Struck and additional evaluations by Rosemary Arden. 
The English version of the questionnaire was used for elicitation.

## Grammar notes
In the basic transitive construction, word order is SVO and both core arguments remain unflagged. Nominal arguments are not indexed on the verb. Many predicative meanings are conveyed bi-partite constructions, displaying some properties of serial verb constructions in diverse combinations. There is no morphological case on nouns. Non-core arguments are flagged by adpositions (typically postpositions).

## Verb lemmas
Lemmas are shown in the form of bare stems, which also serve as present tense forms.
