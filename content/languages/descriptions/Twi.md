The data were gathered in 2024 by Kwadwo Brobbey Nti in his capacity of a native speaker of Twi. In the process of preparing the dataset, we benefited from feedback from Natalia Bogomolova and then Andrey Shluinsky. After this, the data have been substantially reanalyzed based on scholarly consultations by Anna Struck and additional evaluations by Rosemary Arden. 
The English version of the questionnaire was used for elicitation.
