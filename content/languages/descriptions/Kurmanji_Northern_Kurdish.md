## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction
In Kurmanji, the indexing and flagging of the main arguments depends on the tense of the verb. The default transitive construction (TR) shows the accusative alignment in the present tense and the ergative alignment in the past tense, as shown in the following Table.

Table 1. Argument coding in the basic transitive construction depending on tense

|         | X (argument 1) | Y (argument 2) |
| ------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Present | NOM            | OBL            |
| Past    | OBL            | NOM            |

The same tense-conditioned split is also reflected in the indexes on the verb: the object (Y) of the past tense transitive clause receives the same indexing as the subject (X) of present base transitive clause or the subject of the monovalent intransitive verbs, irrespective of the tense. In the data below, Arguments matching the left-hand pattern in the table above are labeled 'SBJ.TR'; those matching the right-hand pattern are labeled 'DO'. The single argument of monovalent intransitive verbs is consistently in the nominative case. Such arguments are labeled "SBJ.INTR" in the data below.
SBJ.TR, SBJ.INTR, and DO are core arguments. Non-core arguments are never tense-dependent tense-dependent. One special class of non-core arguments in the data below is labelled as "IO". These arguments are obligatorily flagged by OBL forms regardless of tense. IO arguments always immediately follow the verb (whereas the default word order for Kurmanji is SOV); IO arguments are sometimes found with motion and transfer verbs. Argument flagging in bivalent intransitive verbs shows some variation, but the first argument typically, their first argument (X) displays the coding behaviour of SBJ.TR or, more rarely, SBJ.INTR. 

### Case system
In Kurmanji, nouns can be masculine or feminine, definite or indefinite, singular or plural. There is no masculine vs. feminine or singular vs. plural distinction when the noun is used in the nominative (NOM) case. The difference is apparent when the noun receives the oblique (OBL) case marking or when it has the ezafe (EZ) marker. In that case, the gender distinction exists in the singular, but is neutralized in the plural. By default, a noun is definite, whereas the indefiniteness is expressed through the -ek suffix. In modern spoken Kurmanji, most masculine nouns no longer receive the OBL marking unless they are indefinite. 
The ezafe marker appears on the head noun (possessee) in the genitive construction. The oblique case is used for objects of present-tense transitive verbs, subjects of past-tense transitive verbs, post-verbal goal and recipient arguments, with prepositions and adpositions, and on the last element of the ezaphe construction (possessor). 
The ezaphe marker often supresses the oblique marking, which can be seen in many examples in the dataset, e.g. #28 or #69.

## Verb lemmas
Verbs are cited in the infinitive form, as they are normally given in Kurmanji dictionaries. Many verbs in Kurmanji are compound, consisting of the inflected light verb *kirin* ‘to do’ or *bûn* ‘to be’ and the second uninflected element, noun or adjective, e.g. *ciza kirin* ‘to punish’, literally ‘to do punishment’. All verbs in Kurmanji have two main inflectional bases: imperfective and perfective. The base of the verb is indicated in the glossing.

## Glossing abbreviations
COP — copula; DIR — directional; EXST — existential predicate; EZ — ezafe; F — feminine; GEN — generic; IMP — imperative; INDEF — indefinite; IPFV — imperfective; M — masculine; NEG — negation; NOM — nominative; OBL — oblique; PERF — perfect; PFV — perfective; PL — plural; PLUPERF — pluperfect; PN — person name; PRS — present; SG — singular.
