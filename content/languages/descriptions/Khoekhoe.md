## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction
The subject (A- or S-argument) is unflagged. The direct object (P-argument)
is either unflagged or flagged by the direct object marker *et* (Differential Object Marking). 
The person, number and gender of the subject can be indexed on the verb (the exact combination 
of features depends on tense and aspect). The two variants of the transitive construction 
are in (1) and (2).

```
(1) Pinχas  aχal           tapuaχ  
    PN      eat[PST.3SG.M] apple  
    “Pinchas ate an apple.”

(2) Pinχas  kofef           et ha  anaf  
    PN      bend[PST.3SG.M] DO DEF branch  
    “Pinchas bent the branch.”
```

Non-core arguments are typically flagged by prepositions.

### Case system
There is no morphological case on nouns.

## Verb lemmas
Verbs are shown in the inflectional form which is used in the translation of the stimulus sentence, e.g. ‘to eat’ is shown as *aχal* = [eat.PST.3SG.M].

## Glossing abbreviations
1, 2, 3 — first, second, third person; CS — construct state; DEF — definite; DO — direct object; F — feminine; INF — infinitive; M — masculine; PL — plural; PN — person name; POSS — possessive; PRS — present; PST — past; PTCP — participle; SG — singular.
