The data were gathered by George Moroz in 2013 from [National Corpus of Polish](http://nkjp.pl), some of the examples were constructed based on Corpus examples. All examples were elicitated with the native speaker of Polish, Elżbieta Garuch.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure

Case marking displays the nominative-accusative alignment. In the basic transitive construction, the A-argument is in the nominative, and the P-argument, in the accusative. The word order is relatively free. For the majority of bivalent predicates, the SVO order is unmarked, other combinations of information structure having communicative and pragmatic functions. The P-argument marking depends on negation: it is accusative in affirmative sentences and genitive, in negative sentences, compare (1) and (2):

```
(1)  Paweł       spotka-ł                  Mart-ę
     PN[NOM.SG]  encounter:PFV-PST[M.3SG]  PN-ACC.SG
     ‘Paweł encountered Marta.’
     
(2)  Paweł       nie  spotka-ł                  Mart-y
     PN[NOM.SG]  NEG  encounter:PFV-PST[M.3SG]  PN-GEN.SG
     ‘Paweł did not encounter Marta.’

```
The verb always agrees with the nominative subject in number and person (and also in gender in the past tense). In analytic forms, agreement is split: the  number and person markers are on the auxiliary and the gender and number are on the participle or participle-like part, see (3) and (4).

```
(3)  Ann-a         podobn-a          jest         do  Magd-y
     PN(F)-NOM.SG  similar-F.NOM.SG  be[PRS.3SG]  at  PN-GEN.SG
    ‘Anna resembles Magda.’

(4)  Janek       będzie       rzuca-ł                kamień
     pn[NOM.SG]  AUX:FUT.3SG  throw:IPFV-PST[M.3SG]  stone[ACC.SG]
     ‘Janek threw a stone.’

```
Non-subjects are never indexed on the verb. Non-core arguments are flagged by oblique case markers and prepositions. The same preposition can be used with different cases, see (5) and (6).

```
(5)  Andrzej     wyszed-ł                 z     dom-u
     pn[NOM.SG]  go_out:PFV\M-PST[M.3SG]  from  house-GEN.SG
     ‘Andrzej went out of the house.’

(6)  Marek       bije                się   z     Tomasz-em
     PN[NOM.SG]  fight:IPFV.PRS.3SG  REFL  with  PN-INS.SG
     ‘Marek is fighting with Tomasz.’

```
