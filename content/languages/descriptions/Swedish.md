## Grammar notes

Swedish has V2 order in main clauses, and though most ways of ordering any other constituents are grammatical, the subject is usually placed in the initial slot before the verb, and always before the object in pragmatically unmarked situations. Full noun phrases always take the default unmarked case (as opposed to the genitive) when they are an argument of a verb or object of a preposition. First and second person pronouns additionally distinguish subject and oblique/non-subject cases. Basic transitive constructions involve two noun phrases which are unaccompanied by prepositions and only marked for case if they are pronouns. 

There are many predicates in the data which do involve prepositions, which may be categorized into four essentially distinct groups, exemplified by (1-4).

```
(1) Björn  höll      med   Maja
    PN     hold.PST  with  PN
    ‘Björn agreed with Maja.’
```

Prepositions like *med* in (1) are characterized by carrying phrasal stress and being comparatively syntactically bound to the verb. The object *Maja* can be freely fronted, but only on its own, as *Maja höll Björn med*.

The verb + preposition combination should be thought of as a lexical unit as it often means something different than the composition of the words’ usual meanings, and the choice of preposition is governed more by the verb than by the usual semantics of the preposition.

```
(2)  ett        sådan-t         här   verktyg  kalla-s        för  en         kompass
     INDF.N.SG  such-INDF.N.SG  here  tool     call-PRS.PASS  for  INDF.C.SG  compass
     ‘This instrument is called a compass.’
```

Prepositions like *för* in (2) are unstressed, but immobile like prepositions of type (1) and still governed lexically by the verb.

```
(3)  Björn  ropa-de   på  Maja
     PN     call-PST  on  PN
     ‘Björn called Maja.’
```

Prepositions like *på* in (3) are unstressed, but more mobile than those of type (1) and (2). For the sentence (3) both the fronted *Maja ropade Björn på* and *på Maja ropade Björn* are grammatical. The preposition should still be considered to form a lexical unit with the verb for the same reasons as in (1) and (2).

```
(4)  stock-en      sjönk     i   vattn-et
     log-DEF.C.SG  sink.PST  in  water-DEF.N.SG
     ‘The log sank in the water.’
```

Prepositions like *i* in (4) are “normal prepositions” in that they are unstressed and mobile like those of type (3), but are also semantically predictable and in contrast to the other categories likely do not form a lexical unit together with the verb.

In this work, prepositions of the types (1) and (2) are considered part of phrasal verbs and are noted as such in the data, and types (3) and (4) are considered part of prepositional phrases together with their object noun. It should be noted that the division between the types (2) and (3) is not always clear, and some judgements differ between speakers.

## Verb lemmas

Lemmas are shown in the full infinitive form (that is, including the infinitive particle *att*, and passive marking for passive constructions), along with any other words with predicative function, such as accompanying prepositions for phrasal verbs.
