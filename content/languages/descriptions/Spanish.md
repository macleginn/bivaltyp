## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Spanish generally displays the nominative-accusative alignment. The subject (A- or S- argument) is unflagged, while the direct object (P-argument) is usually indicated only by word order (SVO) in case of nouns (but see the “Differential object marking” section). However, pronominal arguments differentiate between subjects and direct objects. Besides, clauses with personal pronouns as direct objects normally display the SOV pattern. The person and number of the subject are indexed on the verb, depending on the combination of tense and aspect. Spanish is a pronounced pro-drop language.

### Case system

Spanish has no morphological case on nouns. Personal pronouns (except for the polite pronouns *Usted* and *Ustedes*) have three case-like forms: subject form, direct object form, and indirect object form. Pronominal forms used with prepositions formally coincide with the subject form.

### Differential object marking
Spanish has differential object marking that is realized by means of the preposition *a* before the direct object. Significantly simplifying the situation, the preposition *a* is used only with animate direct objects (that is why it is glossed as DIR.OBJ.ANM), as in (1). Importantly, the same preposition *a* is also used to signal indirect objects, as in (2).

```
(1)  Pedro     respet-a         a            María
     PN[SG.M]  respect-PRS.3SG  DIR.OBJ.ANM  PN[SG.F]
     ‘Pedro respects Maria.’

(2)  Pedro     se        parec-e           a         María
     PN[SG.M]  REFL.3SG  resemble-PRS.3SG  NDIR.OBJ  PN[SG.F]
     ‘Pedro resembles Maria.’

```
### Copulae *ser* and *estar*

As most other languages of Iberia (Portuguese, Catalan, and others), Spanish features two copula verbs, viz. *ser* and *estar*. The verb *ser* is generally used to describe inherent, permanent, and habitual characteristics of a subject, while *estar* is used to encode temporary characteristics. These copulae can be contrasted, cf. (3) and (4):

```
(3)  Pedro  es               loc-o
     PN(M)  be_HAB.PRS.3SG   crazy-M
     ‘Pedro is crazy (in general).’

(4)  Pedro  está              loc-o
     PN(M)  be_PROG.PRS.3SG   crazy-M
     ‘Pedro is being/acting crazy.’

```
## Verb lemmas

Verbs are shown in the infinitive form. For reflexive verbs, the citation form with the enclitical reflexive pronoun is used.
