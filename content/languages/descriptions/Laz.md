The data were gathered in 2023. The language of elicitation was German. Ahmet Aǯar (Vic’e/Vič’e, Vic’e dialect) provided the translations in his capacity of a native speaker.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Valency classes of Laz verbs are primarily defined by their case frames. Unlike the rest of Kartvelian, Laz does not display the so-called “case-shift”, a phenomenon whereby the case marking of arguments depends on the verb’s TAM form. Anyway, Laz features a number of basic case-frame patterns characteristic of the verbs that govern a clause. Canonical transitives assign the ergative and the nominative cases to their subjects and direct objects respectively. Further verb types also exist. 

Laz is not spoken monolingually, its dominant languages being primarily Turkish and, in two villages of southwest Georgia, Georgian. Laz displays a great discrepancy in terms of dialectal variation, as well as significant deviations from the Kartvelian “model” in many respects.
For the purposes of the dataset below, the verb is considered transitive if and only its X-argument is marked for the ergative case, and its Y-argument, for the nominative case, as in (1). 

```
(1)  Käzim-i-k  ferd-išen  kitab-i   k-e-Ø-zd-u
     PN-B-ERG   shelf-ABL  book-NOM  AFF-PRV-DO3-take-S3SG.PST     
     ‘Käzim took a book from the shelf.’ (#8)
```

The traditional four-way distinction of verb classes in Kartvelian applies to Laz as well, including the presence of the so-called inverted verbs, see (Rostovtsev-Popiel 2023) for the disccusion of inversion on Mingrelian data. The verbs in Class II, as in (2), display nominative subjects, and the verbs in Class IV, as in (3), display dative subjects.

```
(2)  Käzim-i  Fatma-šen  ek'-Ø-a-skid-u
     PN-NOM   PN-ABL     PRV-IO3-VER:R-remain-S3SG.PST
     ‘Käzim fell behind Fatma.’ (#65)

(3)  Käzim-i-s  Fatma-Ø  Ø-o-nd-un-Ø
     PN-B-DAT   PN-NOM   IO3-VER:SUP-trust-SM-S3SG
     ‘Käzim trusts Fatma.’ (#114)
```

In bivalent and trivalent verbs, up to two arguments can be cross-referenced on the verb, by prefixal and suffixal markers; only arguments flagged by nominative, ergative and dative cases can be cross-referenced.

### Case system
There are nine basic grammatical cases: nominative, ergative, dative, genitive, instrumental, adverbial, ablative, allative, and benefactive. Apart from the grammatical cases, there are around a dozen semantic cases, primarily coded by postpositional markers. Among these, sociative is found in the dataset.
