The dataset was put together in 2017 by Anastasia Makarova (native speaker of Russian, knowledge of Czech as a foreign language) in consultation with Lucie Taraldsen Medová (native speaker of Czech). The Russian version of the questionnaire was used for elicitation. Anna Vashchenkova contributed greatly contributed to the interlinearizationof the Czech sentences.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure

Case marking displays the nominative-accusative alignment. In the basic transitive construction, the A-argument is in the nominative, and the P-argument in the accusative. In neuter nouns and inanimate masculine nouns the accusative form coincides with the nominative, however, these two forms are consistently interlinearized according to their grammatical feature value. Examples (1) and (2) thereby represent canonical transitive construction, even though the accusative form of *dům* ‘house’ in (1) is zero-marked and coincides with the nominative form of the same noun.

```
(1)  Petr           vidí                dům
     PN(M)[NOM.SG]  see(IPFV).PRS.3SG   house(M)[ACC.SG]
     ‘Petr sees the house.’

(2)  Petr           dohna-l                  Michal-a
     PN(M)[NOM.SG]  catch_up(PFV)-PST[M.SG]  PN(M)-ACC.SG
     ‘Petr caught up with Michal.’

```
The predicate always agrees with the nominative subject in number and person/gender (the choice of agreement features is conditioned by tense). Non-subjects are never indexed on the predicate. Some bivalent predicates expressing physical or emotional states display the Experiencer in the dative (3) or the accusative (4), that, unless expressed by pronominal clitics, takes the thematic position. 

```
(3)  Petr-ovi      se        zdá                  o      Michal-ovi
     PN(M)-DAT.SG  REFL.ACC  dream(IPFV).PRS.3SG  about  PN(M)-LOC.SG
     ‘Petr dreams about Michal’

(4)  Petr-a        bolí                hlav-a
     PN(M)-ACC.SG  ache(IPFV).PRS.3SG  head(F)-NOM.SG
     ‘Petr has a headache.’
```

Non-core arguments are flagged by oblique case markers and prepositions. A number of prepositions can combine with several different cases; valency class labels represent prepositions in combination with the specific case, e.g., NOM\_naACC (where the preposition *na* combines with a noun phrase in the accusative case, cf. example 21 below) and NOM\_naLOC (where the same preposition combines with a noun phrase in the locative case, cf. example 30 below) are considered two different valency patterns, etc.

### Case system
There are 7 full-fledged cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative, and vocative. 

## Verb lemmas
Verbs are cited in their infinitive form specified for aspect (perfective or imperfective).
