Mladen Uhlik and Andreja Žele provided the data in 2017 and 2021 in the capacity of native speakers of Slovenian. The Russian version of the questionnaire was used for elicitation.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Slovenian generally exhibits the nominative-accusative alignment. In the basic transitive construction, the A-argument is in the nominative, and the P-argument in the accusative. The word order is relatively free. For the majority of bivalent predicates, the SVO order is unmarked, other combinations of information structure having communicative and pragmatic functions.

Differential object marking is correlated to negation: the direct object (P-argument) in non-negative sentences is coded by the accusative, while it is expressed by the genitive in negative sentences. 

```

(1) Peter       je       vze-l               knjig-o.
    PN[NOM.SG]  AUX.3SG  take:PFV-LPT[M.SG]  book-ACC.SG
    ‘Peter took a book.’

(2) Peter       ni           vze-l               knjig-e.
    PN[NOM.SG]  NEG.AUX.3SG  take:PFV-LPT[M.SG]  book-GEN.SG
    ‘Peter didn't take book.’

```

The predicate always agrees with the canonical nominative subject in number and person. The analytical predicate containing the l-participle (past and future tenses) or the n- and t-participles (passive constructions) also agrees in gender. Non-subjects are never indexed on the predicate.
Some bivalent predicates expressing physical or emotional states display the Experiencer in the dative (3) or the accusative (4), that, unless expressed by pronominal clitics, takes the thematic position. 

```

(3) Petr-u  se    toži               po     An-i.
    PN-DAT  REFL  miss:IPFV.PRS.3SG  after  PN-DAT
    ‘Peter misses Ana.’

(4) An-o    boli               glav-a.
    PN-ACC  ache:IPFV.PRS.3SG  head-NOM.SG
    ‘Ana has a headache.’

```

Non-core arguments are flagged by oblique case markers and prepositions. The same preposition can be used with different cases. For instance, for prepositional phrases with pred  ‘in front of’  the choice of the case expresses the distinction between direction (5) and location (6).

```

(5) postaviti    pred         vrat-a
    put:PFV.INF  in_front_of  door-ACC.PL
    ‘to put in front of the door’

(6) stati           pred         vrat-i
    stand:IPFV.INF  in_front_of  door-INS.PL
    ‘to stand in front of the door’

```

### Case system
There are 6 full-fledged cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative and instrumental. Instrumental and locative are always used with a preposition.

## Verb lemmas
Verbs are cited in their infinitive form specified for aspect (perfective or imperfective).
