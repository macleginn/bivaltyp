## Grammar notes 

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction
Case marking displays the ergative-nominative alignment, except on personal pronouns, which have non-ergative morphology. In the basic transitive construction, the A-argument is in the ergative, and the P-argument, in the (unmarked) nominative. All oblique cases including the ergative are based on an oblique stem which does not correspond to a case. The verb takes gender-number prefixes, infixes and/or suffixes agreeing with the S/P argument in the nominative. Non-core arguments are flagged by oblique case markers or by postpositions (usually in combination with the locative case or, more rarely, the genitive or the dative case).

### Case system
Overall, there are 19 case forms in Budugh. The original non-locative cases are nominative, ergative, dative, comitative. Historically, the system of locative cases consisted of two layers, involving 5 localizations and 3 directions (the unmarked essive, the lative and the elative), which yields 15 locative combinations. However, most of these combinations have shifted to more abstract, argumental functions; spatial functions were taken over by postpositions. The apudelative is rare and some other cases are lexically restricted. The comitative case also conveys the instrumental meaning. The case labeled as “LOC” synchronically denotes both spatial and more abstract functions, including ‘inalienable genitive’. The former adlocative has become an alienable genitive. (cf. Authier 2013. “The origin of two genitive cases and inalienability split in Budugh (East Caucasian)”, Faits de Langues 41.)
