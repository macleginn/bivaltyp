## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Dutch has V2 order in main clauses with the finite (inflected for subject) verb occupying the second position in the sentence. However, any other verbs, as well as separable verbal prefixes, are placed at the end of the clause. The subject is usually placed in the initial slot before the finite verb.

### Case system

Full noun phrases take the default unmarked case (distinguished from the genitive, which, however, is marginal and is usually replaced with the preposition *van* 'of') when they are an argument of a verb or object of a preposition. The accusative and the dative are not productive and survive only in fixed expressions. Personal pronouns distinguish subject and object cases. Basic transitive constructions involve two noun phrases which are unaccompanied by prepositions and are only marked for case if they are pronouns.

## Verb lemmas

Lemmas are shown in the infinitive (*-en*) form.
