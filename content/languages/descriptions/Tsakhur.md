The data were collected in 2023 using the Russian version of the questionnaire and also its Azerbaijani translation. The data were provided by Ahmed Davudov (see the second picture above) and represent the variety spoken in Mamrux (Azerbaijan). Before 2023, the database featured a limited dataset on Tsakhur that was assembled by Dmitry Gerasimov based on Kibrik et al.'s published materials.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Case marking displays the ergative-nominative (aka absolutive) alignment. In the basic transitive construction, the P-argument is in the nominative, and the A-argument is in the ergative. The ergative case has two allomorphs: *-ee* for most (higher) animates and *-yn* for most animals and for inanimates. The former marker (*-ee*) also marks the inessive on inanimates.

The A-arguments of transitives are never indexed on the verb. The verb agrees in gender-number with the nominative argument (the sole core argument in intransitives or the P-argument of transitives). Thus, both (1) and (2) are examples of the canonical transitive construction.

```
(1)  murad-ee  q:aye     avhu-na
     PN-ERG    stone(A)  A.shoot.PF-A
     ‘Murad threw a stone.’

(2)  gaˁbaˁ-yn   bıkır-ba    džil     gipkır-na
     carpet-ERG  complete-A  clay(A)  A.cover.PF-A
     ‘The carpet covers the whole floor.’
```

The morphology of verbal agreement is extremely complex and often fusional. Non-core arguments are flagged by spatial case markers and postpositions. 

### Case system

There are eight grammatical cases: nominative, ergative, attributive (a threefold gender-number set agreeing with the possessee), caritive, dative, affective, comitative, possessive, and twelve (3x4) spatial cases.

## Verb lemmas

Verbs are cited in their masdar form, which belongs to the perfective paradigm.
