## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Case marking displays the nominative-accusative alignment. In the basic transitive construction (declarative, affirmative, and active), the subject (A- or S-argument) is in the nominative, while the object (P-argument) can have different marking, depending on morphosyntactic and semantic characteristics of the clause. In particular, P-arguments can be marked by the genitive (as in 44), partitive (4), or nominative (50) case. 
Verbs like *viskama* ‘throw’, which allow for both genitive and partitive encoding, are considered transitive. There is, however, a large group of verbs that use only (or predominantly) partitive encoding, such as *armastama* ‘love’ or *ootama* ‘wait’. These are considered intransitive.
The verb normally agrees with the nominative subject in person and number. Non-subjects are never indexed on the verb.
Non-core arguments are usually flagged by oblique cases or adpositions, which typically require genitive or partititve marking on the noun.

### Case system

According to the commonly accepted analysis, Estonian has the total of 14 distinct cases: Nominative, Genitive, Partitive, Illative, Inessive, Elative, Allative, Adessive, Ablative, Translative, Terminative, Essive, Abessive, and Comitative.
