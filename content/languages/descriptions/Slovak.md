The dataset was put together in 2023 by Martin Gális (native speaker of Slovak) and Kirill Kozhanov. The English version of the questionnaire was used for elicitation.

### Basic clause structure

Case marking displays the nominative-accusative alignment. In the basic transitive construction, the A-argument is in the nominative, and the P-argument in the accusative. In neuter nouns and inanimate masculine nouns the accusative form coincides with the nominative, however, these two forms are consistently interlinearized according to their grammatical feature value. Examples (1) and (2) thereby represent canonical transitive construction, even though the accusative form of *dům* ‘house’ in (1) is zero-marked and coincides with the nominative form of the same noun.

```
(1)  Peter          vidí               dom
     PN(M)[NOM.SG]  see(IPFV).PRS.3SG  house(M)[ACC.SG]
     ‘Peter sees the house.’

(2)  Peter          streto-l             Mark-a
     PN(M)[NOM.SG]  meet(PFV)-PST[M.SG]  PN(M)-ACC.SG
     ‘Peter encountered Marek.’

```
The predicate always agrees with the nominative subject in number and person/gender (the choice of agreement features is conditioned by tense). Non-subjects are never indexed on the predicate. 

Non-core arguments are flagged by oblique case markers and prepositions. A number of prepositions can combine with several different cases; valency class labels represent prepositions in combination with the specific case, e.g., NOM\_naACC (where the preposition *na* combines with a noun phrase in the accusative case, cf. example 6 below) and NOM\_naLOC (where the same preposition combines with a noun phrase in the locative case, cf. example 34 below) are considered two different valency patterns, etc.

### Case system
There are 6 full-fledged cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, and locative.

## Verb lemmas
Verbs are cited in their infinitive form specified for aspect (perfective or imperfective).
