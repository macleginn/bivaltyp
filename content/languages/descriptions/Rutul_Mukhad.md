## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Case marking displays the ergative-nominative alignment. In the basic transitive construction, the A-argument is in the ergative, and the P-argument, in the (unmarked) nominative. The ergative form of nouns does not coincide with the oblique stem. The verb takes gender-number prefixes agreeing with the S/P argument in the nominative. These gender-number agreement prefixes can be word-initial but are more often found after deictic preverbs, the reversive and other expressive prefixes, as well as after the negation prefix in some forms. Non-core arguments are flagged by oblique case markers or, rarely, by postpositions (in combination with the genitive case).

### Case system

There are 6 non-locative cases: nominative, ergative, dative, genitive, comitative, and comparative. The system of locative cases consists of two layers: 6 localizations (IN ‘inside (a container)’, AD ‘at, beside’, APUD ‘at, behind’, SUPER ‘on’, SUB ‘under’, CONT ‘in contact with’ and 2 directions (the unmarked ‘locative’ aka essive/lative and the elative), with the contelative serving also as a subelative, which yields 11 locative combinations and 17 cases in all.

## Verb lemmas

Verbs are cited by their masdar form, based on the perfective stem, with IV class agreement.
