Bambara (< Manding < Western Mande < Mande < Niger-Congo) is spoken mainly in Mali (West Africa) by more than 16 million people. 

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Bambara is a tonal language with two basic tones, low and high. The basic word order is S AUX (O) V X, where S is a subject, V is a verb, AUX is an auxiliary word expressing grammatical semantics of tense, aspect, mode and polarity (in the Mandeist tradition, AUX are named "predicative markers"), O is a direct object (whose absence makes the verb intransitive), X is an oblique (indirect object or adjunct), most often represented by a postpositional phrase. The word order in NP is N2 – N1 (N1 is head noun, N2 is dependent noun), N – Adj (the adjectival modifier follows the head noun).

### Case system
