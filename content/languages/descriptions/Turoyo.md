The data were gathered in Berlin in 2023 by Anna-Simona Barbara Üzel and Nikita Kuzin from several speakers of Turoyo. Some additional data were collected by Nikita Kuzin online. The majority of the translations were obtained using the German version of the questionnaire, and several sentences were translated from English.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

The indexing and flagging of arguments in Turoyo depends on whether they are nominal or pronominal and also on the aspectual value of the predicate, yielding a number of intricate patterns. Based on the observed encoding devices in various conditions, I distinguish a number of syntactic statuses that are used for the annotation of the dataset below. The correspondences between syntactic statuses and observed indexing/flagging is summarized in Table 1.

Table 1. Syntactic statuses and morphosyntact encoding

<div class="before-table"></div>

| Syntactic status | Flag  | Index: Nominal, PFV  | Index: Nominal, IPFV  | Index: Pron., PFV  | Index: Pron.,  IPFV |
| ---------------- | ----- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| SBJ              | no    | LS                   | SS                    | LS                 | SS                  |
| SBJ.SS           | no    | SS                   | SS                    | SS                 | SS                  |
| DO               | no    | no                   | no                    | SS                 | LS                  |
| DO.LS            | no    | no                   | no                    | LS                 | LS                  |
| IO               | *l-*  | no                   | no                    | LS                 | LS                  |
| l                | *l-*  | no                   | no                    | no                 | no                  |
| OBJAGR           | no    | LS                   | LS                    | LS                 | LS                  |
| BARE             | no    | no                   | no                    | *                  | *                   |

There is no flagging for nominal subjects (A- and S-arguments) or direct objects (P-arguments). Pronominal and nominal subjects are always indexed on the verb. By default, the so-called S-suffixes (labeled “SS” here) are employed for the imperfective base and the so-called L-suffixes (labeled “LS” here), for the perfective base. Canonical subjects of this type are labeled “SBJ” in Table 1 and in the dataset below. However, a minority of verbs (they are traditionally treated as belonging to the “intransitive” morphological class, see examples 2, 3, 29 etc. below) use S-suffixes to index subjects, irrespective of the base type; subjects of such verbs are labeled “SBJ.SS” in Table 1 and in the dataset below. Analogously, direct objects are split into two statuses, labeled “DO” and “DO.LS,” depending on the inxeding patterns they display (see Table 1 again).
Non-core arguments (with one exception, they are not shown in Table 1) are commonly flagged by prepositions and remain unindexed. In addition to that, there are three separate statuses for non-core arguments — IO, OBJAGR, and BARE. Nominal arguments of the IO type (indirect objects) are flagged by the preposition *l-*, whereas their pronominal counterparts are indexed by L-suffixes (this fact is explained by the fact that L-suffixes can be traced back to this preposition). This status is to be kept apart from a purely prepositional use of *l-*, such as in example 83 (this is included in Table 1 for the sake of comparison). For BARE, see (Say 2020).

### Case system

There is no morphological case on nouns.

## Verb lemmas

Verbs are shown in the so-called *doməx* form: this is the imperfective base form with the zero-realized 3rd person masculine singular S-suffix and no L-suffix. Not all lemmas follow the *doməx* pattern, as they belong to different templates (morphological classes).
