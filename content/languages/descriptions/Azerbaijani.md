The data were collected in 2023. Ayten Babalieva translated the questionnaire sentences in her capacity of a native speaker (using the Russian version of the questionnaire). Both Gilles Authier and Murad Suleymanov edited the dataset and clarified several tricky issues. The interlinearization belongs exclusively to Gilles Authier.
Before 2023, the project featured two consecutive preliminary versions of the {{ language_external }} dataset. These were contributed by Leyla Kurbanova in 2012 and Evgenija Teplukhina in 2018 respectively.
