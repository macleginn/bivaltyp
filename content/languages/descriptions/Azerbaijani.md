The data were collected in 2023 based on the Russian version of the questionnaire. Both Ayten Babalieva and Murad Suleymanov edited the dataset and clarified several tricky issues. The interlinearization belongs exclusively to Gilles Authier.

Before 2023, the project featured two consecutive preliminary versions of the {{ language_external }} dataset. These were contributed by Leyla Kurbanova in 2012 and Evgenija Teplukhina in 2018 respectively.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Case marking displays the nominative-accusative alignment and differential object marking. In the basic transitive construction, the A-argument is in the unmarked nominative. The P-argument, if indefinite is also in the nominative, and must be placed just before the verb. Definite objects are in the accusative and more mobile. Non-core arguments are flagged by oblique case markers (and rarely postpositions).
The verb agrees with the nominative subject (S/A) in number and person. Non-subjects are never indexed on the verb.
Heads in possessive NPs take person-marking possessive suffixes placed before case markers.

### Case system

There are 6 cases: nominative, accusative, genitive (for definite possessors), dative/lative, locative, ablative. 

## Verb lemmas

Verbs are cited in their infinitive form.
