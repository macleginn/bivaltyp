The data were collected in 2023. Ayten Babalieva translated the questionnaire sentences in her capacity of a native speaker (using the Russian version of the questionnaire). [Murad Suleymanov](https://proclac.cnrs.fr/author/msuleymanov/) greatly contributed to the project by editing the dataset and clarifying several tricky issues. The final dataset was cleaned up and interlinearized by Gilles Authier.
Before 2023, the project featured two consecutive preliminary versions of the {{ language_external }} dataset. These were contributed by Leyla Kurbanova in 2012 and Evgenija Teplukhina in 2018 respectively.
