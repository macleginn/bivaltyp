## Grammar notes
### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Case marking displays the ergative-absolutive alignment. In the basic transitive construction, the A-argument is in the ergative, and the P-argument, in the (unmarked) absolutive. The ergative form of nouns coincides with the oblique stem found in other cases. There is no head-marking on the verb. The neutral word order is S(O)V. An example of the transitive construction can be found in (1). Note that in the examples from the questionnaire, the absolutive is not marked with a gloss.

```
(1) aslan.a  k’eǯ   lik’.i-ne  
    PN(ERG)  letter write.PF-AOR 
    “Aslan wrote a/the letter.”

```

Non-core arguments are flagged by oblique case markers or, rarely, by postpositions (in combination with the genitive case).

### Case system
There are 5 non-locative cases: absolutive, ergative, dative, genitive and comitative. The system of locative cases consists of two layers: 7 localizations (IN 'inside (a container)', INTER 'between, in a substance', ANTE 'in front', APUD 'at, near', POST 'behind', SUPER 'on', SUB/CONT 'under, in contact with') and 3 directionals (the unmarked essive, lative and elative), which yields 21 combinations. Locative cases have extended non-locative functions. 

## Verb lemmas
Verbs are cited by the stem which is used in the specific sentence. For example 'to write' is cited as *lik’.i-*, the perfective stem used in (1).
