## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Portuguese generally displays the nominative-accusative alignment. The subject (A- or S- argument) is unflagged, while the direct object (P-argument) is usually indicated only by word order (SVO) in case of nouns (however, see the “Differential object marking” section). However, pronominal arguments differentiate between subjects and direct objects; Besides, Clauses with with personal pronouns as direct objects normally display the SOV pattern. The person, number, and sometimes also gender, of the subject are indexed on the verb, depending on the combination of tense and aspect.

### Case system

Portuguese has no morphological case on nouns. Personal pronouns have four case-like forms: subject form, direct object form, indirect object form, and prepositional form.

### Differential object marking

Traditionally, Portuguese has been described as having Differential object marking in certain contexts, mostly confined to fossilized expressions. Modern Brazilian Portuguese, however, rarely features differential object marking, and almost never in the spoken language.

In the data collected, there are no cases of differential object marking.

The differential object marking, inasmuch as it is possible in Portuguese, is realized by means of the preposition *a* before the direct object. Worth noting is that in Brazilian Portuguese, the usage of this preposition is generally less frequent these days than in the past, and that in the data collected it occurs only twice, where one case is a fossilized expression.

### Copulae *ser* and *estar*

As most other languages of Iberia (Basque as spoken in Spain, Catalan, Spanish, and others) Portuguese features two copula verbs, viz. *ser* and *estar* (glossed as COP_HAB and COP_PROG respectively). The verb *ser* is generally used to describe inherent, permanent, and habitual characteristics of a subject, while *estar* is used to encode temporary characteristics. These copulae can be contrasted, cf. (1) and (2):

```
(1)	 Pedro  é                louc-o
	 PN(M)  COP_HAB.3SG.PRS  crazy-M
	 ‘Pedro is crazy (in general).’

(2)	 Pedro  está              louc-o
	 PN(M)  COP_PROG.3SG.PRS  crazy-M
	 ‘Pedro is being/acting crazy.’

```
