The data were collected in 2013 in Khabarovsk Krai, Russia. Most of the data were gathered from speakers living in the villages of Naikhin and Daerga, who spoke the Naikhin variety, which is the basis of standard Nanai. Some data were also verified with two consultants from Dzhuen, who spoke a Dzhuen variety of Nanai that is very close to Naikhin Nanai.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

The default linear order in Nanai is SOV, although it is not very strict. The nominal subject is expressed with an unmarked form and agrees with the predicate in person and number. The direct object can be expressed with an unmarked form (1), accusative form (2) or a destinative form (3) depending on its semantic and referential parameters (known as Differential Object Marking). However, examples with an unmarked object were absent from the questionnaire since the stimuli contained highly referential objects. Additionally, examples with the destinative form are also absent due to the lack of appropriate contexts.

```
(1)  ʒele  puju-u-ri
     head  boil-IMPS-NPST
     ‘They boil a head (of a hunted animal)’ (text, recorded in Sinda in 2011)

(2)  Petia  ǯolo-wa    naŋga.la-xa-ni
     PN     stone-OBL  throw.PFV-PST-P.3SG
     ‘Petia threw a stone.’

(3)  N'oani  ǯea-go-i               gələ-j-ni.
     3SG     friend-DEST-P.REFL.SG  ask-NPST-P.3SG
     ‘He is looking for a friend’.

```

All other verbal arguments are expressed with other case forms or with postpositional phrases.

TAM-features are indexed on the verb forms and do not affect argument encoding.

### Case system

Nanai has 9 cases. The list of case suffixes is given below in Table 1.

Table 1. Nanai case system

|      Case            |      Marker                        |      Gloss     |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|----------------|
|     Nominative       |     unmarked                       |     —          |
|     Accusative       |     -*wa*/-*wə*~-*ba*/-*b*ə        |     OBL        |
|     Destinative      |     -*go* / -*gu*                  |     DEST       |
|     Instrumental     |     -*ǯi*                          |     INS        |
|     Dative/Essive    |     -*do*/-*du*                    |     DAT        |
|     Locative         |     -*la*/-*lə*~-*dola*/-*dulə*    |     LOC        |
|     Directive        |     -*či*                          |     DIR        |
|     Ablative         |     -*ǯia(ǯi)*/-*ǯiə(ǯi)*          |     ABL        |

The accusative suffix does not occur in a form with a reflexive possessive marker. The destinative case always occurs with a possessive suffix indicating a future possessor of an object, see (3). The oblique case forms of the personal possessive paradigm include the same suffix as the accusative case, which is glossed as oblique (OBL), see the personal possessive declension of *ogda* ‘boat’ in Table 2 (only forms of 2SG are given).
