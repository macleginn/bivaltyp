The English version of the questionnaire was used for elicitation. The identification of valency encoding devices and valency classes is primarily based on the system proposed by Sergei Klimenko (2019), which might deviate from the analytic decisions used elsewhere. Sergei Klimenko's generous assistance with the data analysis is gratefully acknowledged.
