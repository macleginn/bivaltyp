## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Latin generally shows the nominative-accusative alignment. Usually, the A-argument is in the Nominative, and the P-argument, in the Accusative. Latin allows for a relatively flexible word order. In Classical Latin prose, the default linear pattern is subject, indirect object, direct object, adverbial words or phrases, verb (more generally, the SOV-pattern). Infinitives and other extra verbs are placed in front of the main verb. Not much evidence has survived of the word order in colloquial Latin. Poetic word order depended heavily on the meter (based on vowel quantity), as well as served rhetorical expressiveness.

The verb must agree in number (Singular, Plural) and person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with the subject. If the predicate includes a nominal form (such as adjective or participle), it also must agree with the subject in gender (Masculine, Feminine, Neuter). 

### Case system

Latin case system comprises six cases: Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative, Ablative and Vocative (for animate nouns). Accusative and Ablative can have a locative function (Accusative signifies directionality, and Ablative, a stative location) and can be used either with or without a preposition. Ablative also may have an instrumental function.
