The data were collected during the fieldtrips to the village of Kina, Rutul rayon of the Republic of Daghestan, in {{ data_collection_year }}. The Russian version of the questionnaire was used for elicitation.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Both case marking and agreement display the ergative-nominative alignment. In the basic transitive construction, the A-argument is in the ergative, and the P-argument, in the (unmarked) nominative (also referred to as absolutive). Most verbal forms are derived either from the perfective or from the imperfective stem. The verb cross-references the P- or S-argument, with four genders, 1 (masculine), 2 (feminine), which in the plural merge into HPL (human plural); and 3 and 4, which in the plural merge into NPL (non-human plural). Some verbs additionally show vowel alternation in animate plural forms. In most verbal forms, Gender 1, Gender 4 and NPL are zero marked. The neutral word order is SV / APV. An example of the transitive construction can be found in (1).

```
(1) rasul-a l-ešu-r           kitab
    PN-ERG  PV-1.take.PFV-CVB book(NOM)
    ‘Rasul took a book.’
```


Virtually any verb has the nominative as one of its arguments. With some verbs, however, the position of the nominative argument is taken by a stem which can be more or less autonomous as a noun.

```
(2) rasul-u-s    χatir    a<d>gɨ-r=a             asijet-ɨ-la
    PN-OBL-DAT   grudge   <4>be.stuck.PFV-CVB=be PN-OBL(SUP)-EL
    ‘Rasul took offence at Asijat.’
```

The second, non-nominative argument of a two-place intransitive predicate may be one of the many inflected forms of the noun described in the following section. Sometimes arguments are flagged by postpositions.

### Case system

The nominal inflection includes two subparadigms, abstract (syntactic, non-locative) cases and spatial inflection. Abstract cases are expressed by single suffixes and include nominative, ergative, dative and comitative. The possessive suffix is a cross-categorial attributivizer (ATTR). Spatial forms are based on a template that includes two slots. The first is obligatorily filled by one of the suffixes of the category of localization (defining a spatial domain with respect to the landmark, including SUP for ‘on’, IN for ‘inside’, APUD for ‘near’, SUB for ‘under’ and INTER for ‘between’ or ‘in a substance’). The second slot expresses the category of directionality and may be left unfilled, in which case the whole form expresses the meaning of static location (as in ‘on the table’, or Place) or motion into the designated domain (as in ‘on(to) the table’, or Goal). Otherwise, the form may be elative (as in ‘from the table’, or Source), in which case the localization suffix is followed by the elative suffix -*la* (for SUP and INTER) or increases the length of the suffix vowel (for IN and APUD); for SUB, the elative suffix is fused with the localization suffix. Abstract cases and spatial forms, a total of 15 forms, are widely used to mark various verbal arguments, although to very different extents depending on the specific form, see the database. All inflectional suffixes are added to the oblique stem (glossed OBL), most often derived by one of a set of lexically distributed suffixes.

## Verb lemmas

Verbs are cited by the form which is used in the specific sentence. For example ‘to take’ is cited as *lešur*, the specific perfective form used in (1), which contains the preverb *l*- and the converb marker -*r* and signals that the P-argument is from Gender 1.
