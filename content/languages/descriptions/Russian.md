The data are presented using [scientific transliteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_transliteration_of_Cyrillic). As a result, morphemic boundaries follow some idiosyncrasies of the Russian orthography, cf. *plat'-ju* (rather than morphologically more accurate *plat'j-u*) [dress(N)-DAT.SG], which corresponds to the orthographic *плать-ю*.

## Grammar notes
### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Case marking displays the nominative-accusative alignment. In the basic transitive construction, the A-argument is in the nominative, and the P-argument, in the accusative. Even though the accusative form coincides with the nominative form in some declension classes, these two forms are consistently interlinearized according to their grammatical feature value. Thus, both (1) and (2) are examples of the canonical transitive construction, even though the accusative form of *rot* 'mouth' in (2) is zero-marked and coincides with the nominative form of the same noun.


```
(1) devočk-a       uvide-l-a          kot-a
    girl(F)-NOM.SG see(PFV)-PST-F.SG  cat(M)-ACC.SG
    'The girl saw a cat.'

(2) mal'čik      otkry-l              rot
    boy(M)[M.SG] open(PFV)-PST[M.SG]  mouth(M)[ACC.SG]
    'The boy opened his mouth.'

```

Declension class assignment is largely conditioned by gender and animacy, but partially is lexically idiosyncratic. The nominative-accusative syncretism is more typical of inanimate nouns (and never observed in personal pronouns).

The verb always agrees with the nominative subject in number and person/gender (the choice of agreement features is conditioned by tense). Non-subjects are never indexed on the verb.

Non-core arguments are flagged by oblique case markers and prepositions. Many prepositions can combine with several different cases; valency class labels represent prepositions in combination with the specific case, e.g., NOM\_naACC (where the preposition *na* combines with a noun phrase in the accusative case) and NOM\_naLOC (where the same preposition combines with a noun phrase in the locative case) are considered two different valency patterns, etc.

### Case system
There are 6 full-fledged cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental and locative. 

## Verb lemmas
Verbs are cited in their infinitive form specified for aspect (perfective or imperfective).

## Glossing abbreviations
3 — third person; ACC — accusative; DAT — dative; F — feminine; GEN — genitive; IMP — imperative; INS — instrumental; IPFV — imperfective; LOC — locative; M — masculine; N — neutral; NOM — nominative; PFV — perfective; PL — plural; PN — person name; PRED — predicative form; PRS — present; PST — past; REFL — reflexive; SG — singular.
