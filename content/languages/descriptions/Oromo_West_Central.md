## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Oromo has SOV syntax with head-initial NPs, showing a typologically uncommon combination of verb-finality versus head-modifier order. In terms of alignment of NPs, it belongs to the marked-nominative type, the uniquely African phenomenon: here, A and S employ identical explicit markers (nominative form), which differentiates them from O, which is formally unmarked (absolute form). The alignment pattern here is like in the accusative languages (nominative-accusative alignment) because it treats S and A similarly against the O, but what is unusual is that the unmarked form signals the O argument.

```
(1)  barattoot-ni	 kitaaba   fuɗ-at-an-i
     student-NOM	 book.ABS	 take-MID-3PL-PFV
     ‘Students took books.’

(2)  inni       (u)nu    waam-a
     3SG.M.NOM  1PL.ABS  call-3SG.M.IPFV
     ‘He calls/invites us.’

```
The verb indexes the subject for person, number, and gender. The indexing is explicit with most subjects, including the 3PL agent in (1), while others, including the 3SG.M subject in (2), are zero-indexed.

### General morphological profile
Oromo is a predominantly suffixing language and can be characterized by a complex morphological system where some elements are loaded with several functions. In addition, morphemes are fused together involving varied and intricate phonological processes. For instance, vowel length shows multiple functions by itself and in combination with other suffixes.

### Case system
Nouns and pronouns are morphologically marked for case. The common cases in Oromo include nominative, absolute, dative, genitive, instrumental, locative, ablative, and vocative. The absolute is just the citation form while the others are distinctly marked. The case system is categorized as the core case (nominative, absolute) and the peripheral case (the remaining ones). Below are a few case paradigms for (in)definite nouns.

The non-core cases are primarily associated with spatial senses, and they often involve vowel length in the morphological marking. The ablative is signalled by the vowel length and usually involves the adposition *irra* ‘on’ as its host, cf. *seenaa irraa* [history.ABS on.ABL] ‘from history’. The vowel length on the right-most constituent of the possessor NP marks the genitive case and is sometimes paired with the particle kan before the possessor.

```
(3)  mala          (kan)  nama  gabaabaa
     strategy.ABS  (GEN)  man   short.GEN
     ‘strategy of a short man’

(4)  sangaa  (kan)  nam-ittʃaa
     ox.ABS  (GEN)  man-DEF.GEN
     ‘the man’s ox’

```
The locative marker is a suffix *-tti* attached to a noun or pronoun, but it sometimes occurs as *itti* in the discourse (as a pronominal element). 

```
(5)  kubbaa    isaan-tti  darbaɗɗ-u
     ball.ABS  3PL-LOC    throw.2SG-IMP
     ‘Throw a ball to them.’

(6)  kubbaa    itti  darbaɗɗ-u
     ball.ABS  LOC   throw.2SG-IMP
     ‘Throw a ball to them/him/her.’ (The addressee is discourse specific.)  

```

### Verbs
There are main verbs, copulas, and auxiliaries in Oromo. The main verbs identify perfective and imperfective aspects, but some sort of tense is also observable with auxiliary verbs. The perfective aspect is marked by the suffixes [-*e*, -*i*], and the imperfective by [-*a*, -*u*, -*i*] occurring as final morphemes in the sequence of suffixes. The potential verb suffixes marking the middle, causative, and passive are followed by the subject indexes and the aspect markers, and the verb indexes the subject/agent argument for person, number, and gender. 

Table 2ː Agreement suffixes and imperfective aspect markers (exemplified by the verb root *raf-* 'to sleep')

|     Persons    |     AGR      |     IPFV    |     Inflected form    |     Translation         |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
|     1SG        |     -Ø-      |     -a      |     raf-a             |     ‘I sleep.’          |
|     2SG        |     -t-      |     -a      |     raf-t-a           |     ‘You sleep.’        |
|     3SGM       |     -Ø-      |     -a      |     raf-a             |     ‘He sleeps.’        |
|     3SGF       |     -t-      |     -i      |     raf-t-i           |     ‘She sleeps.’       |
|     1PL        |     -n-      |     -a      |     raf-n-a           |     ‘We sleep.’         |
|     2PL        |     - t -    |     -u      |     raf-t-u           |     ‘You sleep (PL)’    |
|     3PL        |     - Ø -    |     -u      |     raf-u             |     ‘They sleep.’       |

The copulas are *ɗa*, -*ti*, Ø used in the present tense (e.g., *iʃeen barattuu ɗa* ‘she is a student’), and the negative copula is *miti* (e.g., *iʃeen barattuu miti* ‘she is not a student’). The past forms of copular clauses involve the existential auxiliary tur- ‘existed/there was’ (e.g., *iʃeen barattuu turte* ‘she was a student.’). The verb *tur*- attaches agreement suffix and aspect marker. The auxiliaries *dʒir*- ‘exists/there is’ and *tur*- ‘existed/there was’ are often used in the converb constructions and progressive verb forms. 

## Verb lemmas
Verbs are quoted in their perfective or imperfective stems. The verb forms like *waammata* ‘he calls for himself’ are used as citation forms below; these forms contain valency changing suffixes (if necessary) as well as the 3SG.M subject index and aspect markers.
