The Russian version of the questionnaire was used for elicitation. The data were collected in 2022 and 2025 in Mikhajlovskoe. They represent the Mikhajlovskij (sub)dialect of Ludic (Karelian). Whether Ludic is a language or a dialect of the Karelian language is a matter of debate.

## Grammar notes
### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction
In Ludic, singular direct objects are coded by forms that coincide with the genitive case, while plural direct objects are coded by forms that coincide with the nominative case. Several analytic decisions are possible (e.g. describing this patterns as a case of Differential Object Marking), however, in what follows all such forms are intereted as accusative case forms.
