## Grammar notes
### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction
Case marking displays the ergative-absolutive alignment. In the basic transitive construction, the A-argument is in the ergative, and the P-argument, 
in the (unmarked) nominative (which can also be referred to as absolutive). Nouns are classified into 4 genders, or noun classes. The gender of the nominative 
argument can be indexed on the verb by a prefix or infix; other arguments are never indexed. Whether or not the nominative argument is indexed is the lexical 
property of the verb, independent of its transitivity. The number of the nominative argument is sometimes expressed by verb stem alternations. Transitive 
clauses with and without gender indexing can be found in (1) and (2).

```
(1) ali-di ɡurdo             r-uχ.i  
    PN-ERG shirt[INAN2][NOM] INAN2-take_off.PST(AOR)  
    “Ali bent the branch.”

(2) ali-di intʃi             k’amm.i  
    PN-ERG apple[INAN1][NOM] eat.PST(AOR)  
    “Ali ate an apple.”
```

Non-core arguments are flagged by oblique case markers.

## Case system
There are 21 cases (including locative cases that express both localization and direction).

## Verb lemmas
Verbs are cited in the inflectional form which is used in the translation of the stimulus 
sentence, with morpheme boundaries shown. Gender indexes, if present, are shown in angle 
brackets, e.g. ‘to take off’ is shown as *&lt;r&gt;-uχ.i* = [INAN2-take_off.PST(AOR)].
