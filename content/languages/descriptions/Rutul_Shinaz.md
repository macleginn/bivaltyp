The data were collected in 2023 using the Russian version of the questionnaire. The data have been generously provided by Ramazan Atrashovich Ramazanov (pictured above), who also takes care of the [website](https://www.shinaz.ru/index.html) specifically dedicated to the history and culture of Shinaz.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Case marking displays the ergative-nominative alignment. In the basic transitive construction, the A-argument is in the ergative, and the P-argument, in the (unmarked) nominative. The ergative form of nouns coincides with the oblique stem in the plural only; it is usually unmarked on proper and some higher animate nouns like ‘father’ and ‘mother’.

The verb takes gender-number prefixes agreeing with the S/P argument in the nominative. These gender-number agreement prefixes can be word-initial but are more often found after deictic preverbs, as well as after the negation prefix in some forms. Non-core arguments are flagged by oblique case markers or, rarely, by postpositions (in combination with the genitive case).

### Case system

Shinaz Rutul is undederdescribed. Probably, there is a total of 15 case forms (see Ibragimova 2019: 202-203), whereas the Standard Rutul based on the Mukhad dialect, has 17 distinct case forms. However, in the Shinaz Rutul dataset below only 12 cases are used, of which 5 are abstract cases and 7 are spatial cases. 

The 5 abstract cases used are nominative, ergative, dative, attributive, and comitative (= instrumental). 
5 locative cases merge essive and lative orientations: IN ‘inside’, SUPER ‘on’, AD ‘at, beside’, CONT ‘in contact with’ and APUD ‘at, behind’. Two further cases attested in the dataset have the meaning of the elative orientation, namely EL ‘(outside) from’ and CONTEL ‘from in contact with’.

Example (12) in the dataset beloww shows a nominative unmarked form used to denote the goal of motion.
