The data were provided by Ksenia Shagal in 2017 based on her second-language knowledge and consultations with native speakers. The English version of the questionnaire was used for the consultations. The data presented here were kindly proofread by [Olli Silvennoinen](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/olli-silvennoinen) in 2021.

## Grammar notes
### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Case marking displays the nominative-accusative alignment. In the basic transitive construction (declarative, affirmative, and active), the subject (A- or S-argument) is in the nominative, while the object (P-argument) can have different marking depending on morphosyntactic and semantic characteristics of the clause. In perfective contexts, totally affected objects, or the so-called “total objects”, can be expressed by the genitive with singular nouns, as in (1), or the nominative with plural nouns, as in (2), or by a specialized accusative form, which only exists in personal pronouns, as in (3): 

```
(1) Pekka   löy-si        avaim-en
    PN.NOM  find-PST.3SG  key-GEN
    ‘Pekka found the key.’

(2) Pekka   löy-si        avaim-et
    PN.NOM  find-PST.3SG  key-NOM.PL
    ‘Pekka found the keys.’

(3) Pekka   löy-si        minut
    PN.NOM  find-PST.3SG  1SG.ACC
    ‘Pekka found me.’

```

In imperfective contexts or when the object is not totally affected, it can be expressed by the partitive; compare (4) with a total object in the genitive to (5) with a partitive object:

```
(4) Pekka   joi            maido-n
    PN.NOM  drink.PST.3SG  milk-GEN
    ‘Pekka drank the milk.’

(5) Pekka   juo             maito-a
    PN.NOM  drink.PRS.3SGg  milk-PART
    ‘Pekka drinks milk.’

```

Verbs like *juoda* ‘drink’, which allow for both genitive and partitive encoding, are considered transitive. There is, however, a large group of verbs that use only (or predominantly) partitive encoding, such as *rakastaa* ‘love’ or *odottaa* ‘wait’. These are considered intransitive.
In the standard language, the verb normally agrees with the nominative subject in person and number. Non-subjects are never indexed on the verb.
Non-core arguments are usually flagged by oblique cases or by postpositions, which typically require genitive marking on the noun.

### Case system
Finnish has fifteen cases: nominative, genitive, partitive, accusative, essive, translative, inessive, elative, illative, adessive, ablative, allative, abessive, comitative, and instructive.

## Verb lemmas
Verbs are cited in their infinitive form.
