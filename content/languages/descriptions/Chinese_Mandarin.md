Yuru Xu provided the data in 2023 in her capacity of a native speaker of Mandarin Chinese. The English  version of the questionnaire was used for elicitation. 
Before 2023, BivalTyp displayed a preliminary version of the Mandarin Chinese data provided by Elena Kolpachkova in 2012. Elena Kolpachkova's data and analysis are available in the form of a published article:

Kolpachkova, E. N. 2018.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

As an isolating language, Mandarin Chinese has no morphological case on nouns and and no verb indices. The basic transitive construction displays a neutral alignment in terms of case marking and indexing. Word order functions as the main argument-encoding device in the Mandarin Chinese transitive construction. The basic word order of transitive constructions involving two noun phrases is subject-verb-object (SVO). Deviations from this pattern are discussed and exemplified in i), ii), and iii).

i) The passive construction with a passive marker 被 *bèi* is normally used when there is a sense of misfortune or adversity. The passive marker and the agent noun phrase occupy the position between the subject (the patient noun phrase) and the verb. 被*bèi* is sometimes considered to be a preposition.

```
(1)  张三       被    一-只     狗     咬    了。
     Zhāngsān  bèi   yì-zhī    gǒu   yǎo   le
     Zhangsan  PASS  one-CLF   dog   bite  PFV
     ‘Zhangsan was bitten by a dog.’
     
```

ii) The predicates generally denoting position, appearance or disappearance may have an ergative structure. In this case, the subject position is empty, the location is expressed in the preverbal position and the post-verbal (object) position corresponds to the locatum (sometimes considered the semantic subject of the predicate).

```
(2) 那个       桶-里           装满         了    水。
    nèi-ge    tǒng-lǐ         zhuāngmǎn   le    shuǐ
    that-CLF  bucket-inside   fill_up     PFV   water
    ‘The bucket filled with water’  (Lit. ‘There is full of water in the bucket.’)

```

3) In co-verb constructions involving prepositions, such as 对 *duì* (3), 和 *hé*, etc., the object accompanied by the prepositios is placed in the slot before the verb, forming a subject-object-verb (SOV) sentence. In this work, 把 *bǎ* is also considered as preposition. But it should be noted that the analysis of the grammatical status of the *ba*-construction differs between researchers and speakers.

```
(3) 年龄       对        记忆力    有    影响。
    niánlíng  duì       jìyìlì   yǒu   yǐngxiǎng
    age       towards   memory   have  influence
    ‘Age influences memory.’

```

However, comparative constructions with 于 *yú* (4) and 像 *xiàng* have the basic SVO word order. 

```
(4) 张三       落后         于     李四   了。
    Zhāngsān  luò-hòu      yú    Lǐsì   le
    Zhangsan  fall-behind  to    Lisi   PFV 
    ‘Zhangsan fell behind Lisi.’

```

In addition, the Chinese copular verb 是 *shì* ‘to be’ is often omitted when the predicate is an adjectival or a locative phrase.

```
(5) 张三         对        他  儿子    很     满意。
    Zhāngsān    duì       tā  érzi   hěn    mǎnyì
    Zhangsan    towards   he  son    very   content
     ‘Zhangsan is very content with his son.’

```

### Case system

According to most descriptions, Mandarin Chinese has no morphological case.

## Verb lemmas

Verbs are cited in the unmarked form, which is normally a bare root (sometimes accompanied by an aspectual marker).

## Graphic conventions and glossing abbreviations

### Tone diacritics in the Pinyin system

ā - first tone (high and flat); á - second tone (rising); ǎ - third tone (falling-rising); à - fourth tone (falling); a - fifth tone (neutral).

### Glossing abbreviations

BA  — marker of the *ba*-construction; CLF — classifier; DE — pre-nominal and pre-verbial modification marker or postverbal resultative marker *de*; EXP — experiential aspect marker *guo*; PASS — passive marker *bei*; PFV — perfective; PROG — progressive; ZHE — durative aspect marker *zhe*.
