## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

In Kazakh, the default linear pattern is SOV. In the transitive construction, nominal subjects are used in the unmarked form and direct objects are used either in the unmarked form (1) or in the accusative case (2) depending on their animacy and referentiality (Differential Object Marking).

```
(1)  Petya  tas    laqtïr-dï.
     Petya  stone  throw-PST1.3SG
     ‘Petya threw a stone.’ 

(2)  Petya  kilt-ti    tap-tï.
     Petya  key-ACC    found-PST1.3SG
     ‘Petya found the keys.’     

```

The predicate agrees with the subject in person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and number (singular, plural). Non-core arguments are flagged by oblique cases or by postpositions.
The verbal tenses in the examples include the first present (the main verb in converbial form and the auxiliary verb), the second present (marked with *-a*, *-y*, *-e*), the first past (*-dï*, *-di*, *-tï*, *-ti*) or the second past (*-ɣan*, *-ɣen*, *-qan*, *-qen*). 

### Case system

The case system includes seven cases for nouns, viz. the unmarked nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, ablative and instrumental, as exemplified for the noun *bala* ‘child’ below:

```

Nominative    bala      child.NOM
Genitive      bala-nïŋ  child-GEN
Dative        bala-ɣa   child-DAT
Accusative    bala-nï   child-ACC
Locative      bala-da   child-LOC
Ablative      bala-dan  child-ABL
Instrumental  bala-men  child-INS

```
