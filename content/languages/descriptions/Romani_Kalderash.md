## Grammar notes
### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Romani is predominantly an SVO language.

In Romani, a transitive construction involves subjects in the direct form (= nominative; for details, see Section “Case system”) and direct objects, which can either appear in the same direct form (see 1) when they are inanimate and indefinite nominal objects or be marked by the oblique form (= accusative) when they are animate and definite (see 2). Pronominal direct objects are always marked by the oblique (see 3). The exact factors conditioning the differential object marking vary across dialects, but in Kalderash Romani, they include part-of-speech distinction, animacy, and definiteness.

```
(1)  o             Murš-a     dikh-əl      o             khər
     ART.M.DIR.SG  PN-NOM.SG  see-PRS.3SG  ART.M.DIR.SG  house[ACC.SG]
     ‘Murša sees a house.’

(2)  o             Murš-a      dikh-əl      la            Marijk-a
     ART.M.DIR.SG  PN-NOM.SG   see-PRS.3SG  ART.F.OBL.SG  PN-ACC.SG
     ‘Murša sees Marijka.’

(3)  o             Murš-a      dikh-əl      la
     ART.M.DIR.SG  PN-NOM.SG   see-PRS.3SG  she.ACC
     ‘Murša sees her.’

```

In Romani, verbs typically have subject indexes for person and number. Additionally, in Kalderash Romani, direct objects—and more rarely other arguments, such as the possessor in a predicative possession construction—can also be indexed on the verb by a pronominal clitic (originating from the oblique form), as in (4).

```

(4)  leste   sy        les    mator-a
     he.LOC  be.PRS.3  he.CL  car-NOM.SG
     ‘He has a car.’

```
In Romani, most prepositions require the nominative (= direct form) with nouns and the locative case with pronouns.

### Case system

Romani has eight cases, usually refered to as nominative, accusative, ablative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative, and vocative. The basic morphological distinction between direct and oblique nominal forms (the latter typically marked by a suffix) is involved in the differential object marking described above. Direct forms (= nominative) are used for the subjects of transitive and intransitive verbs as well as for inanimate and indefinite direct objects, whereas oblique forms are used for animate and definite direct objects (= accusative) and express other functions, such as marking a possessor in a predicative possession construction, the indirect object of the verb ‘give’, and the experiencer of certain verbs like ‘feel pain’, ‘like’, ‘seems’.

In Kalderash Romani, the ablative and locative cases are flagged inflectionally on pronouns and by the prepositions *kata* and *ka*, respectively, on nouns (see 5–6). In this variety, these prepositions are used exclusively for grammatical case marking.

```

(5)  o             Murš-a     dar-al        kata  źukəl
     ART.M.DIR.SG  PN-NOM.SG  fear-PRS.3SG  from  dog.NOM.SG
     ‘Murša is afraid of the dog.’

(6)  o             Murš-a     dar-al        lestar
     ART.M.DIR.SG  PN-NOM.SG  fear-PRS.3SG  he.ABL
     ‘Murša is afraid of it/him.’

```
