## Grammar notes

In Danish, the finite verb always occupies the second slot in the sentence (V2). The first slot is occupied with the topic which often coincides with the subject (SVO).

Nouns inflect for number (singular, plural) and definiteness (definite, indefinite). Only personal pronouns show case distinction (nominative, oblique). Nouns fall into two genders (common, neuter) that manifest themselves in the forms of the definiteness markers: *en* with common nouns and *et* with neuter nouns. Indefinite articles precede the noun (*en bil* ‘a car,’ *et dyr* ‘an animal’). Definite articles either appear as bound morphemes following the noun (*bil-en* ‘the car,’ *dyr-et* ‘the animal’), or, if the noun is modified by an adjective, precede the modifier (*den nye bil* ‘the new car’, *det vilde dyr* ‘the wild animal’). Most adjectives agree with nouns: indefinite forms have the endings *-Ø* or *-t* in the singular, and *-e* in the plural, whereas the ending of all definite forms is *-e*, cf. (1) and (2).

```
(1)  Peter  sang      en       smuk            sang
     PN     sing.PST  INDF.SG  beautiful.C.SG  song(C)
    ‘Peter sang a beautiful song.’

(2)  Peter  sang      den     smukk-e        sang
     PN     sing.PST  DEF.SG  beautiful-DEF  song(C)
     ‘Peter sang the beautiful song.’

```

Verbs do not conjugate for person or number. The infinitive suffix *-e* is used if a stem ends in a consonant, otherwise the infinitive form coincides with the stem (cf. *led-e* ‘look for’ and *tro* ‘believe’). In the present tense, almost all verbs have the suffix *-r*, except for a few irregular verbs (but their stems undergo certain morphophonological alternations, for example, *kunne* ‘can.INF’ : *kan* ‘can,PRS’). Regular verbs form the past tense forms with the suffixes *-te* or *-ede*. The past forms of the irregular verbs are morphophonologically transformed stems (*angribe* ‘attack.INF’ : *angreb* ‘attacked’). There are also present and past participles formed with the suffixes *-ende* and *-t* correspondingly. Past participles are used in analytical passives together with the verbs *blive* ‘become’ and *være* ‘be’ (for instance, *blev fornærme-t* ‘became offended’, *var imponere-t* ‘was impressed’). Synthetic passive is formed with the suffix *-s* (*hustet male-s* ‘the house is being painted’). Besides the bare stem, which is used for imperatives, there are no more synthetic verb forms. 

The basic transitive construction in Danish consists of two unmarked noun phrases if they are nouns or person names, whereas pronouns in the position of the second argument are marked for the oblique case. Objects of non-transitive verbs are marked with prepositions. 

The combination of a verb and a preposition is considered as a lexical unit in the following cases.

i.	If it is given as a lexeme in the dictionary Den Danske Ordbog: for example, *tage på* ‘put on’, *stige af* ‘get down from' (lit. 'clamber off'), *slå ned* ‘strike' (lit. 'hit down').

ii.	If the preposition is mobile and can move to the end of the clause: for example, *putte i* ‘pour’, see (3):

```
(3)  Peter  putte-de  sukker-et        i
     PN     put-PST   sugar(N)-DEF.SG  in
     ‘Peter poured the sugar.’

```

iii.	If there are more than one preposition associated with the verb: for example, *synke ned* ‘sink’, see (4):

```
(4)  Kævl-en        sank      ned   i   vand-et
     log(C)-DEF.SG  sink.PST  down  in  water(N)-DEF.SG
     ‘The log sank in the water.’

```

Clausal arguments are marked with the bound morph *at*, see (5):

```
(5)  Peter  er      oppe  at  slås        med   Marie
     PN     be.PRS  up    to  flight.INF  with  PN
     ‘Peter is up to fight with Marie.’

```

## Verb lemmas

Verbs are given in the infinitive form (see above). Non-verbal predicates are shown as phrases consisting of a verb in the form of the infinitive and a nominal element in the form used in the given sentence (*være venner* ‘be friends’). An adverbial modifier is considered as a part of the predicate if this modifier is an important component of the predicative meaning (*have nok* ‘have enough’).
