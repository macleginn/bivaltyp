The data were gathered in 2023 from the following consultants: Zurab Apakiʒe (primary), K’onst’ant’ine Nač’q’ebia, Iza Nač’q’ebia, Raisa Pircxelava, Beniamin Ǯobava (all from Čxoroc’q’u). The language of elicitation was English with the primary consultant and Georgian with the rest. Many thanks go to Merab Čuxua (Chukhua) for his invaluable comments on Megrelian lexis.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Valency classes of Mingrelian verbs are primarily defined by their case frames. However, all Mingrelian verbs, except for inverted statives, display the so-called “case-shift”: a phenomenon whereby the case marking of the arguments depends on the verb’s TAME form. Mingrelian TAME forms group into four so-called “series”, where Series I comprises present, imperfect, and future TAMEs belonging to various moods; Series II contains aorists, imperatives and optatives; Series III contains perfect and pluperfects of various moods; and Series IV largely replicates Series I, but with additional evidential and aspectual nuances. Simplifying somewhat, case marking in (non-inverted) verbs undergoing case-shift can be represented in Table 1.

Table 1. Verbs with case-shift: case marking in the four series

<div class="before-table"></div>

|            | Subject | Direct object | Indirect object |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Series I   | NOM     | DAT           | DAT             |
| Series II  | ERG     | NOM           | DAT             |
| Series III | DAT     | NOM           | [ALL]           |
| Series IV  | NOM     | DAT           | DAT             |

For the purposes of the dataset below, the verb is considered transitive if and only if it displays case-shift (see Rostovtsev-Popiel 2023) so that its X-argument is case-marked as the “Subject”, and its Y-argument is case-marked as the “Direct object” in Table 1. The valency-encoding devices for the two core arguments in transitive constructions are labeled as “ERG” and “NOM” respectively, even if the actual sentence happens not to belong to Series II and the actual forms used are, thus, not ERG and NOM. For example, the equivalent of ‘plough’ (#66) in (2) is allotted to the same class as the equivalent of ‘take’ (#8) in (1), even though the two exemplar sentences display discrepant case frames.

```

(1)  čelo-Ø  ʔvana-s    Ø-bar-un-s=u
     PN-NOM  field-DAT  DO3-plough-SM-S3SG=EV
     ‘Chelo is ploughing the field.’

(2)  čelo-k  c'ing-i   ge-gl-Ø-i-γ-u
     PN-ERG  book-NOM  PFV-PRV-DO3-VER:S-take-S3SG.PST
     ‘Chelo took a book.’

```

Thus, the labels used in the annotation of transitive verbs correspond to the actual case frame in Series II (ERG, NOM). The same convention applies to case-shifting verbs that do not meet the aforementioned transitivity criterion. For example, the equivalent of ‘think’ (#25) is labeled as an “ERG_ABL” verb, even though the actual questionnaire sentence in (3) belongs to Series I and displays a nominative subject (X argument).

```

(3)  čelo-Ø  anučia-še(n)  Ø-pirk-en-s
     PN-NOM  PN-ABL        S3-think-SM-S3SG
     ‘Chelo thinks about Anuchia.’

```

The case-shift scheme represented in Table 1 above is only a part of the complex system that relates verbs classes, TAME-forms and case frames in Mingrelian. For an overview of further details, see (Rostovtsev-Popiel 2023), especially Table 8.1 there.

### Case system

There are ten grammatical cases: nominative, ergative, dative (core cases), genitive, instrumental, adverbial (oblique cases), two ablatives (for the purposes of this study, they are treated as one), allative, and benefactive (secondary cases). Some of these cases are not featured in the dataset below. All four secondary cases are morphologically based on the genitive. Apart from grammatical cases, there are further case-like expressions, such as the sociative, which is featured in several entries below.

## Verb lemmas

Verbs are cited in the 3SG form of either Present or Future tense (as indicated in each instance). Future forms are shown in case the Present tense form is not sufficiently informative with respect to the verb’s lexical semantics.
