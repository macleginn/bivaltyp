## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction
The subject (A- or S-argument) is unflagged. The direct object (P-argument) is either unflagged or flagged by the direct object marker *et* (Differential Object Marking). The person, number and gender of the subject can be indexed on the verb (the exact combination of features depends on tense and aspect). The two variants of the transitive construction are in (1) and (2).

1. *Pinχas aχal tapuaχ*  
Pinchas eat[PST.3SG.M] apple  
“P. ate an apple.”

2. *Pinχas kofef et ha anaf*  
Pinchas bend[PST.3SG.M] DO DEF branch  
“P. bent the branch.”

Non-core arguments are typically flagged by prepositions.

## Case system
There is no morphological case on nouns.

## Verb lemmas
Verbs are shown in the inflectional form which is used in the translation of the stimulus sentence, e.g. ‘to eat’ is shown as *aχal* = [eat.PST.3SG.M].
