## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Two main features of case marking in Telugu are: nominative-accusative alignment and differential object marking. In the basic transitive construction, the A-argument is in the nominative case, and the P-argument is either in the accusative or in the nominative case, depending on the salience of the object. Only nominative subjects are cross-referenced on the verb. The neutral word order is SOV. An example of the transitive construction can be found in (1). 

```
(1)  maheṣ         uttaraṃ           /  uttarānni         rāsāḍu
	   PN(M).SG.NOM  answer(N).SG.NOM  /  answer(N).SG.ACC  write.PST.3SG.M
     ‘Mahesh wrote a/the letter.’

```

Non-core arguments are flagged by case markers or postpositions (normally in combination with the oblique nominal stem). For the majority of nouns, the genitive form coincides with the oblique stem found in other cases. Even though the oblique stem, in turn, coincides with the nominative for a large number of nouns, these forms are consistently tagged according to their grammatical feature value.

### Case system

The borderline between case suffixes and postpositions is blurred. Commonly recognized cases are: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative and locative. Comitative/instrumental, causal and some other markers, sometimes included into the Telugu case system, are treated here as postpositions. 

## Verb lemmas

Verbs are cited as bare stems, not used in any actual construction. For example, the verb 'write' from the example (1) is cited as *rāyu*.
