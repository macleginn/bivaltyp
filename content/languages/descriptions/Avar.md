## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure

Clause structure in Avar is dominated by case marking on nominals and by gender-number agreement with the nominative argument on verbs. Constituent order indicates only information structure. Most affective and perception verbs mark the experiencer in the general locative case. Bivalent transitive verbs have their patientive argument in the nominative case and their agentive argument in the ergative case. Ditransitive verbs are transitive verbs with an extended argument. Verbs of speech have the adressee in the general locative case. Verbs of transfer have a permanent recipient argument in the dative. The apudlative is used for *non-permanent* recipients. Verbs of contact are ditransitive. They cast the goal in a locative case and the instrument or bodypart in the nominative case.
