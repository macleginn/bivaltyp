## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Clause structure in Avar is dominated by case marking on nominals and by gender-number agreement with the nominative argument on verbs. Constituent order indicates only information structure. Most affective and perception verbs mark the experiencer in the general locative case. Bivalent transitive verbs have their patientive argument in the nominative case and their agentive argument in the ergative case. Ditransitive verbs are transitive verbs with an extended argument. Verbs of speech have the adressee in the general locative case. Verbs of transfer have a permanent recipient argument in the dative. The apudlative is used for *non-permanent* recipients. Verbs of contact are ditransitive. They cast the goal in a locative case and the instrument or bodypart in the nominative case.

### Case system

Noun inflection expresses number and case. Avar has the total of 24 cases, divided between 4 grammatical cases and 20 spatial cases. The nominative singular has no overt marking, but a final vowel in the nominative form can be dropped in the oblique stem. In the singular, the formation of the oblique stem shows a high degree of allomorphy and many cases of free variation. Apart from the ergative (which may or may not be identical with the oblique stem), other case markers are identical for all declensions, for grammatical as well as spatial cases. The four grammatical cases are the nominative, ergative, dative and genitive, as shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Grammatical cases in Avar: some declension patterns

|            |     ‘boy’           |     ‘tongue’          |     ‘wolf’          |     ‘wolves’        |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
|     NOM    |     *was*           |     *mac’:*           |     *bac’*          |     *bac’-al*       |
|     ERG    |     *was-as:*       |     *mac’:-aɬ:*       |     *bac’-i-c:a*    |     *bac’-az*       |
|     DAT    |     *was-as:-e*     |     *mac’:-aɬ:-e*     |     *bac’-e*        |     *bac’-az-e*     |
|     GEN    |     *was-as:-ul*    |     *mac’:-aɬ:-ul*    |     *bac’-i-l*      |     *bac’-az-ul*    |

Avar spatial cases are expressed as combinations of 5 localizations with 4 orientation forms as shown in Table 2. The essive orientation series has no overt marker, so that the localization morphemes are clearly visible in this series. Avar localization morphemes all reconstruct for the main branches of East Caucasian (cf. Alekseev 1997). Orientation markers are more recent.

Table 2. Avar spatial cases

|              |     essive      |     lative      |     elative       |     translative      |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
|     LOC      |     *-da*       |     *-de*       |     *-da-s:a*     |     *-da-s:a-n*      |
|     APUD     |     *-q*        |     *-q-e*      |     *-q-a*        |     *-q-a-n*         |
|     INTER    |     *-ɬ:*       |     *-ɬ:-e*     |     *-ɬ:-a*       |     *-ɬ:-a-n*        |
|     SUB      |     *-ƛ’*       |     *-ƛ’-e*     |     *-ƛ’-a*       |     *-ƛ’-a-n*        |
|     SUPER    |     *-t’a*      |     *-t’e*      |     *-t’a-s:a*    |     *-t’as:a-n*      |

In the case tags used below in the glosses, the zero-marked essive orientation is not shown, so that LOC stands for the combination of the LOC localization and essive orientation, INTER stands for the combination of the INTER localization and essive orientation, etc. In a similar vein, apart from the already mentioned LOC case, the general locative series (LOC) is not represented in the glosses, so that EL stands for the combination of the general locative series and the elative orientation, etc. 

Note that standard Avar has not fully grammaticalized as a bound case from the locative marker SUPER ‘on’, which usually appears as free adverbs *t’ad*, *tade* and *t’as:a(n)* following the general locative case. The general locative series denotes a position typical for the referent, including ‘on’, and is used as a grammatical case in many bivalent frames.
