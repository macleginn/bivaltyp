The data were gathered in 2021 in Kazym, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug–Yugra, Russia and supplemented with the data from the Kazym dialect segment of the Khanty texts corpus (prepared by E. Kashkin within the program of the presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences “Corpus Linguistics” in 2012–2014). The Russian version of the questionnaire was used for elicitation. Data collection was supported by a grant from the Russian Science Foundation: “Argument structure, voice and valency-changing derivations in the languages of Western Siberia”, grant No. 19-78-10139. We also thank Nikita Muraviev and Anna Melnik for their assistance in data collection.

## Grammar notes
### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction
The basic word order is S(O)V. Subjects and direct objects are distinguished by dependent marking only in pronouns, which have formally distinct nominative and accusative forms. Nouns remain unmarked in both subject and direct object positions.

The verb agrees with the subject in person and number in transitive and intransitive constructions and, under certain conditions, in number with the direct object of the transitive construction. In transitive clauses, the choice between the subject and subject-object indexing depends on the topicality of the direct object (Differential Object Indexing). In case the direct object is pragmatically more prominent than the subject, the passive construction is favored.

### Case system
There are four cases: nominative, accusative, dative, and locative. Nominative and accusative are formally distinct only in pronouns. Postpositions combine with the nouns in the unmarked form (glossed as NOM).

## Verb lemmas
The verbs are cited in the basic non-finite form of the nonpast tense.
