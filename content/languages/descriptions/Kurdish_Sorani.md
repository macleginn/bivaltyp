## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Due to the limited case distinctions in Sorani Kurdish (see below), the primary strategy for differentiating core arguments involves the use of pronominal indexes. The relevant pronominal forms are presented in Table 1.

|     | independent pronoun | gloss | pronominal clitics | gloss    | verbal agreement marker   |          | gloss |
| --- | ------------------- | ----- | ------------------ | -------- | ------------------------- | ------------- | -- | 
|     |                     |       |                    |          | set I (Present)           | set II (Past) |  |
| 1SG | \*min\*             | I     | \*=im\*            | \=1SG.PC | \*-(i)m\*                 | \*-(i)m\*     | 1SG |

| 3SG | \*ew\*              | s/he  | \*=î\*            | \=3SG.PC | \*-a(t) / -ê(t) / -Ø\*    | \*-∅\*        | 3SG |
| 1PL | \*ême\*            | we    | \*=man\*           | \=1PL.PC | \*-în\*                  | \*-în\*      | 1PL |
| 2PL | \*êwe\*            | you   | \*=tan\*           | \=2PL.PC | \*-(i)n\*                 | \*-(i)n\*     | 2PL |
| 3PL | \*ewan\*            | they  | \*=yan\*           | \=3PL.PC | \*-(i)n\*                 | \*-(i)n\*     | 3PL |

Independent pronouns are used relatively rarely and are included here primarily for illustrative purposes. The main distinction is between the two series of forms conventionally labeled 'pronominal clitics' and 'verb agreement markers.' Note that the three series of pronominal forms are glossed differently to facilitate navigation through the dataset below.

Similarly to most modern Indo-Iranian languages (Holmberg 2004), Sorani Kurdish displays a split-ergative alignment conditioned by tense. In particular, the present tense constructions exhibit accusative alignment, in which the verb agrees in number and person with the subject (S/A) via verbal agreement markers suffixed on the verb stem. The use of verbal agreement markers is obligatory regardless whether the verb is intransitive (1) or transitive (2, 3) and also whether the subject is (2) or is not (3) expressed by a full noun phrase (or an independent pronoun).

(1) minał-k-an de-r̂o-n bo xiwêndinge

children-DEF-PL IND-go.PRS-3PL for school

‘The children are going to school.’

(2) min perdax-ek-an de-ʂikên-im

I glass-DEF-PL IND-break.PRS-1SG

I break the glasses. 

(3) perdax-ek-an de-ʂikên-im

glass-DEF-PL IND-break.PRS-1SG

I break the glasses.

Overt objects are not indexed on the verb (3). However, pronominal clitics are used for objects that are not expressed by a full noun phrase or an independent pronouns (4). The placement of pronominal clitics follows complicated rules but they are not necesarilly attached to the verb.

(4) de=yan-ʂikên-im

IND=3PL.PC-break.PRS-1SG

I break them.

Past tense constructions display the ergative alignment. In intransitive constructions, subjects (S) are indexed on the verb by verbal agreement markers (5).

(5) ke ême r̂oîşt-în, êwe geîşt-in

when we leave.PST-1PL you arrive.PST-2PL

‘When we left you arrived.’

In transitive constructions subjects (As) are indexed by pronominal clitics regardless of whether they also are (6) or are not (7) expressed by full noun phrases (or independent pronouns). Again, the placement of pronominal clitics follows complicated rules but they are not necesarilly attached to the verb (7) and (8).

(7) min perdax-ek-an=m ʂikand-∅

I glass-DEF-PL=1SG.PC break.PST-3SG

I broke the glasses.

(8) perdax-ek-an=m ʂikand-∅

glass-DEF-PL=1SG.PC break.PST-3SG

I broke the glasses.

Finally, direct objects (Os) expressed by overt noun phrases are not indexed on the verb; this can also be interpreted as the use of the default 3SG agreement markers, see (7) and (8). However, non-lexical objects are expressed by verbal agreement markers (9). Overall, the argument indexing in the past tense transitive constructions is the mirror image of the argument indexing in the present tense.

(9) ʂikand=im-in

break.PST=1SG.PC-3PL

I broke them.

Apart from indexing O-arguments in the present tense and A-arguments in the past tense, pronominal clitics signal possessors within noun phrases, as in (10).

(10) kiras-eke=m pîs-e

shirt-DEF=1SG.PC dirty-be.PRS.3SG

My shirt is dirty.

Finally, possessive noun phrases are normally built using the izafe construction, in which the possessee precedes the possessor is marked by the izafe "-î" suffix that is used independently of the possessor's person and number, cf. (11) and (12). 

(11) ser-î Hîwa 

head-IZF PN 

'Hiwa's head'

(12) ser-î min

head-IZF PN

'My head'.

As follows from the discussion above, the distribution of pronominal forms can be used for the identification of basic valency patterns in Sorani Kurdish. In the dataset below, "SBJ" (subject) is used as a label for A/S arguments defined as the arguments that are indexed by verbal agreement markers in the present tense. The label DO (direct object) is the label used for O arguments defined as arguments that can be indexed by verbal agreement markers in the past tense but not in the present tense. 

Most non-core arguments, i.e. arguments are neither labelled as "SBJ" or "DO" in the dataset below, are flagged by various adpositions. However, there is also a class of arguments that was labelled "EXT" (external). An example of a construction involving such an argument in given in (13).

(13) Hîwa ewr̂o laq-ek-an=î d-êʂ-in.
PN today foot-DEF-PL=3SG.PC IND-hurt.PRS-3PL
'Hiwa's feet ache today'.

Here, the verb agrees with the body part ('feet'), which is encoded as a canonical subject (SBJ). However, the possessor is not encoded as a canonical phrase-internal dependent, as evidenced by clause-initial position and the lack of the izafe marker, cf. (11) above. Moreover, the use of the clause-level adverb *ewr̂o* 'today' shows that the possessor is not part of the noun phrase headed by the possessee. In short, the possessor/experiencer is extraposed, so that the literal rendition of (13) would be something like 'Hiwa, his feet ache today'. It is precisely for arguments of this kind that the label "EXT" is used in the dataset below.

### Case system

Case does not play a significant role in the grammar of Sorani Kurdish. In some contexts, non-subjects (e.g. objects within prepositional phrases) are marked with the residual case marker *-î* (glossed as "OBL" in the dataset below), as in (14).

(14) Hîwa le Selîm-î de-ç-ê
PN from PN-OBL IND-go.PRS-3SG
‘Hiwa believes Selim.’
