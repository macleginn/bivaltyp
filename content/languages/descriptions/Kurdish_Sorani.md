## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Due to the limited case distinctions in Sorani Kurdish (see below), the primary strategy for differentiating core arguments involves the use of pronominal indexes. The relevant pronominal forms are presented in Table 1.

Independent pronouns are used relatively rarely and are included here primarily for illustrative purposes. The main distinction is between the two series of forms conventionally labeled 'pronominal clitics' and 'verb agreement markers.' Note that the three series of pronominal forms are glossed differently to facilitate navigation through the dataset below.
