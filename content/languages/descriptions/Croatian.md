## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Case marking displays the nominative-accusative alignment. In the basic transitive construction, the A-argument is in the nominative, and the P-argument, in the accusative. Even though the accusative form coincides with the nominative form in some declension classes, these two forms are consistently interlinearized according to their grammatical feature value. Thus, both (1) and (2) are examples of the canonical transitive construction, even though the accusative form of *nos* ‘nose’ in (2) is zero-marked and coincides with the nominative form of the same noun.

```

(1)  Djevojčic-a  je          vidje-l-a                 kos-a.
     girl-NOM.SG  be.PRS.3SG  see(IPFV)-PART.PERF-F.SG  blackbird-ACC.SG
     ‘The girl saw the blackbird.’

(2)  Dječak         je          obrisa-o                  nos.
     child[NOM.SG]  be.PRS.3SG  wipe(PFV)-PART.PERF.M.SG  nose[ACC.SG]
     ‘The boy wiped his nose.’
```

The nominative-accusative syncretism is more typical of inanimate nouns (and never observed in personal pronouns).
The predicate practically always agrees with the canonical nominative subject in number and person. In most analytical forms, including the basic past tense form, the predicate also displays gender agreement with the subject. Non-subjects are never indexed on the predicate.
Non-core arguments are flagged by oblique case markers and prepositions. Many prepositions can combine with several different cases; valency class labels represent prepositions in combination with the specific case, e.g., NOM_sGEN (where the preposition *s* combines with a noun phrase in the genitive case) and NOM_sINS (where the same preposition combines with a noun phrase in the instrumental case) are considered two different valency patterns, etc.
The relative order of nominal arguments and the verb is relatively free. For the majority of bivalent predicates, the SVO order is the unmarked choice if both arguments are nominal. However, alternative word order patterns are possible.  
Pronouns differentiate between stressed and unstressed (enclitic) forms. The enclitics are usually placed in the clause-second position (after the first phrase or after the first accented word inside a phrase) and their relative order is fixed. Zero subjects (the so-called pro-drop) are common.

### Case system
In standard Croatian, there are 7 full-fledged cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental and vocative. Locative forms are always used with a preposition. The contrast between the locative and the dative case is on the verge of extinction and manifests itself exclusively by pitch accent differences. The case systems in dialectal Croatian can slightly differ from the standard one, for instance in the sense of better preservation of the locative or extinction of the vocative case.

### Verb lemmas
Verbs are cited in their infinitive form specified for aspect (perfective or imperfective).
