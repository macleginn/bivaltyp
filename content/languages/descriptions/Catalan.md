## Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

The basic word order in Catalan is SVO. In the basic transitive construction, the object remains unmarked. Signalling direct objects with the preposition *a* is only marginal in Catalan; thus, there is almost no Differential Object Marking (unlike in Spanish). There are no instances of direct objects signalled by *a* in the collected data.

## Case system

In Catalan, there are no morphological cases on nouns. The distinctive feature of this language is the large quantity of unstressed pronouns that distinguish such cases as dative and accusative. The form of a pronoun depends on its position with respect to the verb, and whether it is adjacent to a vowel or a consonant in the verb. Combinations of unstressed pronouns can be cliticized to the same host.

## Personal articles

Catalan uses the personal articles before peopleâ€™s names, viz. *en* or *el* for masculine names and *la* for feminine names.

## Verb lemmas

Verbs are shown in the infinitive form.
