## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Like other languages of the Nakh-Dagestanian family, Kadar Dargwa is a morphologically ergative language, although many syntactic processes follow the nominative-accusative pattern. It is a basically left-branching language with relatively free word order. Kadar shows rich agreement both in gender/number (nominal class) and person.

For several centuries, Kadar has been strongly influenced by Kumyk (Turkic), which resulted in many essential differences between Kadar and other varieties of Dargwa. In particular, Kadar shows a relatively reduced morphology with smaller numbers of categories and forms (both in the nominal and verbal domain) than most Dargwic languages.

### Case system

There is no detailed grammatical description of Kadar. In a corpus of Kadar oral texts (Vagizieva, Sumbatova, Sokur 2023), we attested nine cases: nominative, ergative, dative, genitive, allative/comitative, superlative/superessive, illative/inessive, elative, and comparative. The basic case markers are shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Case markers of Kadar

|      case                      |      marker           |      gloss     |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
|     Nominative                 |     unmarked          |     NOM        |
|     Ergative                   |     *-li*             |     ERG        |
|     Dative                     |     *-s*              |     DAT        |
|     Genitive                   |     *-la*             |     GEN        |
|     Allative/Comitative        |     *-ču*             |     AD         |
|     Superlative/Superessive    |     *-ke*             |     SUPER      |
|     Illative/Inessive          |     *-ze*             |     IN         |
|     Elative                    |     *-zaka*, *-ka*    |     EL         |
|     Comparative                |     *-kem*            |     COMP       |

R. O. Mutalov and M. S. Bagamaeva (2019) also mention the allative case with the marker -daħize and the themative case marked by -kela; the list of spatial case forms in (Chechuro 2016: 47) includes interelative (-keka), but these case forms have not been attested in our texts. 

## Verb lemmas
