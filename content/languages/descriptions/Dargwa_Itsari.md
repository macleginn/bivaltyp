The data were gathered in 2018 and then revised in 2024 and 2025. The Russian version of the questionnaire was used for elicitation. Nina Sumbatova has greatly contributed to the interlinearization and interpretation of the data.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Like other languages of the Nakh-Dagestanian family, Itsari Dargwa is a morphologically ergative language, although many syntactic processes follow the nominative-accusative pattern. It is a basically left-branching language with relatively free word order. Itsari shows rich agreement both in gender/number (nominal class) and person. Itsari Dargwa exhibits rich agglutinative morphology both in nominal and verbal domain.

### Case system
The grammatical cases include the absolutive, ergative, genitive, comitative, contentive, and instrumental. A remarkable feature of the Itsari Dargwa case system is the absence of a dedicated dative case. The corresponding functions are performed by the superlative case (see below). The basic markers of grammatical cases are shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Markers of grammatical cases in Itsari Dargwa

|      case           |      marker      |
|---------------------|------------------|
|     Absolutive      |     unmarked     |
|     Ergative        |     *-li*/*-lli* |
|     Genitive        |     *-la*/*-lla* |
|     Comitative      |     *-cːilli*    |
|     Contentive      |     *-čilla*     |
|     Instrumental    |     *-ibli*      |

The locative (spatial) forms express two spatial categories: localization and orientation. Itsari has five localizations and four orientations, whose combinations result in 20 locative case forms. The localization markers are shown in Table 2.

Table 2. Localization markers in Itsari Dargwa

|      localization           |      marker                |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
|     SUPER   ‘on’            |     *-j*                   |
|     SUB   ‘under’           |     *-gu*                  |
|     ANTE   ‘in front of’    |     *-sa*                  |
|     POST   ‘behind’         |     *-ha*                  |
|     IN   ‘inside’           |     *-cːi* (or irregular)  |

The four orientations include lative (unmarked), essive, elative and directional (allative). When unaccompanied by an orientation marker, locative forms denote the motion towards a location. The essive orientation (stative position) is marked by gender agreement suffix, which follows the localization morpheme. The elative orientation (motion from the object) is expressed by adding the suffix *-r* (*-r-tːal*/*-r-tːalli*, in free variation); the directional orientation means motion towards the object without reaching it and is expressed by the combination of a gender marker and the suffix *-al*/*-alli*. 

## Verb lemmas
Itsari Dargwa does not have infinitive forms. The typical functions of the infinitive are performed by the subjunctive forms, which inflect for person/number. For citation, we use the 3rd person subjunctive forms (marked by *-araj*/*-anaj* in the intransitive verbs, *-uj* in the transitive verbs). For the roots that have aspectual pairs we give the aspectual variant that is used in the corresponding example. Similarly, the verbs that agree in gender are cited with the gender marker that is attested in the example. The gender markers are separated by the equality sign (‘=’); other morphemic breaks are indicated by a hyphen.
