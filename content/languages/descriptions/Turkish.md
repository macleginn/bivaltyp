Turkish belongs to the Oghuz sub-branch of the Turkic branch of the assumed Altaic language family. The examples are given using the standard orthograthy except that the apostrophes between the stems of proper names and case suffixes are omitted.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

In the transitive construction, nominal subjects are used in the unmarked form and direct objects are used either in the unmarked form (1) or in the accusative case (2) depending on their animacy and referentiality (Differential Object Marking).

```
(1) Mehmet	ilginç		bir	kitap	oku-du.
    PN		interesting	one	book  	read-PST
    ‘Mehmet read an interesting book.’

(2) Mehmet	kitab-ı		raf-tan		al-dı.
    PN      	book-ACC  	shelf-ABL	take-PST
    ‘Mehmet took the book from the shelf.’ 
```

The predicate agrees with the subject in person and number. 3rd person singular agreement markers have zero exponents and are not reflected in the glosses.
Non-core arguments are flagged by oblique cases or by postpositions. The comitative marker can be realized either as a suffix or as a postposition. All the postpositions attested in the questionnaire take the unmarked or the genitive form of the noun.
The genitive case can mark clause-level constituents standing in a possessive relationship with the subject (3). These constituents can be freely separated from their (semantic) possessees, the possessees can be pronominalized, etc.

```
(3) Mehmed-in	şimdi	on	lira-sı		kal-dı.
    PN-GEN      now  	ten	lira-P.3	remain-PST
    ‘Now Mehmet has 10 liras left.’ 
```

The verbal tense forms in the examples are glossed as present (marked with *-yor*), past (*-dı*) or aorist (*-r*). The tense form traditionally called aorist is used to describe habitual events, permanent states and (some) future events.

## Case system
The case system includes five cases for nouns, viz. the unmarked nominative, genitive, accusative, dative, locative and ablative.

## Verb lemmas
The verbs are shown in the form of the infinitive in *-mak*.
