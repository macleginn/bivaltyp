## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and transitive constructions
Macedonian shows nominative-accusative alignment. In a basic transitive clause, the A-argument appears in the nominative, and the P-argument in the accusative.

A major caveat is that the nominal case system has largely collapsed in Macedonian. Overt case marking is preserved only in the pronominal system, which distinguishes nominative, accusative, and dative forms. For full nouns, case distinctions are no longer morphologically expressed. Instead:

	• definite direct and indirect objects are obligatorily reduplicated by the corresponding object pronoun, accusative or dative (in which case the noun phrase has an article unless it is a proper name; the article is redundant when the noun is modified by a demonstrative pronoun);
	• indefinite objects are not repudlicated and are distinguished primarily by word order (e.g. (4) Petar frli kamen ‘Petar threw a stone’). Word order, however, is strongly influenced by focus and topicalization.

Non-core arguments are introduced by prepositions, including na. They must be distinguished from indirect objects, which are likewise marked with the preposition na. A clear distinction is possible only when the indirect object is definite, since in that case it is obligatorily accompanied by a dative pronoun. Compare:

	• (6) Petar liči na Maja ‘Petar resembles Maja’: Maja is treated as a non-core argument and introduced by na, without being reduplicated.
	• (7) Petar ì veruva na Maja ‘Petar trusts Maja’: Maja is the definite indirect object and introduced by na as well as obligatorily reduplicated by ì.

The verb agrees with the subject in person and number/gender (depending on tense and mood/evidentiality). Objects are never indexed on the verb.

Word order is relatively free, but the basic unmarked order is SVO. Pronominal object clitics (including those that double definite noun phrases) always precede the verb as proclitics.

### Case system
Effectively, Macedonian nouns lack case inflection. Only the pronominal system maintains nominative, accusative, and dative forms. However, a reduced set of dependent forms of nouns sometimes appears (e.g. in numeral phrases, after prepositions, or in certain syntactic contexts), but their use is optional. The vocative also remains productive.

## Verb lemmas
Verbs are cited in the 3rd person singular present tense. Macedonian lacks an infinitive.
