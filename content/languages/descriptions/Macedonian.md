## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and transitive constructions
Macedonian shows nominative-accusative alignment. In a basic transitive clause with nominal arguments both core arguments remain unflagged. By contrast, pronominal arguments in the basic transitive construction are differentiated by case, with the A-argument appearing in the nominative, and the P-argument, in the accusative case.

More generally, the nominal case system has largely collapsed in Macedonian. Overt case marking is preserved only in the pronominal system, which distinguishes nominative, accusative, and dative forms. For full nouns, case distinctions are no longer morphologically expressed. Instead:

- definite direct and indirect (see below) objects are obligatorily reduplicated by the corresponding object pronoun, accusative or dative (in which case the noun phrase has an article unless it is a proper name; the article is redundant when the noun is modified by a demonstrative pronoun);
- indefinite objects are not repudlicated and are distinguished primarily by word order, as in ex. (1) below, where the nominal arguments occupy different positions, shaping the AVP pattern. 

```
(1)  Petar  frli               kamen
     PN     throw:PFV.AOR.3SG  stone(M).SG
     ‘Petar threw a stone.’
```
	
However, word order is strongly influenced by focus and topicalization and is not fully shaped by grammatical relations.

Oblique nominal arguments (arguments other than A, S and P) are introduced by prepositions, as in (2). 

```
(2)  Petar  se    plaši                    od    kuče
     PN     REFL  be_afraid(IPFV).PRS.3SG  from  dog(N).SG
     ‘Petar is afraid of the dog.’
```

Importantly, there are two types of nominal objects flagged by the preposition *na* 'on', which are analyzed as representing distinct valency classes below. A clear distinction between these two classes is possible only when the relevant argument is definite, cf. (3) and (4).

```
(3)  Petar  ì              veruva                 na  Maja 
     PN     PRO.3SG.F.DAT  believe(IPFV).PRS.3SG  on  PN
     ‘Petar believes Maja’

(4)  Petar  liči                    na  Maja 
     PN     resemble(IPFV).PRS.3SG  on  PN
     ‘Petar resembles Maja’
```

In (3), the definite object is obligatorily doubled by a dative pronoun. Such arguments are tagged as "DAT(na)" in the dataset below and are interpreted as indirect objects. In (4), the nominal argument cannot be doubled by a dative pronoun; moreover, in sentences with the verb *liči* 'resemble' pronominal arguments are also flaged by the same preposition *na* 'on'. Such arguments are tagged "na" in the dataset below and are interpreted as obliques. 

The verb agrees with the subject in person and number/gender (depending on tense and mood/evidentiality). Objects are never indexed on the verb.

Word order is relatively free, but the basic unmarked order is SVO. Pronominal object clitics (including those that double definite noun phrases) always precede the verb as proclitics.

### Case system
Effectively, Macedonian nouns lack case inflection. Only the pronominal system maintains nominative, accusative, and dative forms. However, a reduced set of dependent forms of nouns sometimes appears (e.g. in numeral phrases, after prepositions, or in certain syntactic contexts), but their use is optional. The vocative also remains productive.

## Verb lemmas
Verbs are cited in the 3rd person singular present tense. Macedonian lacks an infinitive.
