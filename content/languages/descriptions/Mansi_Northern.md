## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction 

The basic word order is SOV. Subjects and direct objects, if represented by nouns, do not distinguish between each other since the language does not have a nominal accusative case. Only personal pronouns have a separate “accusative” form which consists of the pronoun and a possessive suffix of the same person and number. 
The verb has a subject conjugation, where it agrees with the subject in person and number, and an object conjugation, where it additionally agrees with the object in number. Object conjugation is grammatically possible for all transitive verbs and for transitive verbs only. The choice of conjugation is based on topicality, sometimes definiteness and other factors. Sometimes passive voice is used to promote a topical constituent to the subject position and for some other purposes. 

### Case system

In Northern Mansi, there are 6 nominal cases: nominative, lative, locative, instrumental, elative, translative. As mentioned earlier, personal pronouns have a special “accusative” form. 

## Verb lemmas

The verbs are cited in several forms in the questionnaire, the most common being NPST.3SG and PST.3SG
