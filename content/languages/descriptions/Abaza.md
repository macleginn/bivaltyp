The data were gathered in {{ data_collection_year }} in the village Inzhich-Chukun of the Abazinsky district of the Karachay-Cherkess Republic. They represent the Tapanta dialect. The Russian version of the questionnaire was used for elicitation.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction
Abaza is a polysynthetic language with almost exceptionless head-marking. All arguments of the verb are indexed on the verb by person/number and gender (class) prefixes.
Argument indexing displays the ergative alignment. There are two types of indexes: absolutive prefixes are used for encoding S- and O-arguments and non-absolutive prefixes are used for encoding all other arguments. If non-absolutive indexes are used for encoding A-arguments, they are referred to as “ergative” indexes; otherwise, they are referred to as “indirect object” indexes. The actual form of indexes in shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Person/number and gender indexes

<div class="before-table"></div>

|              |     ABS        |     ERG/IO          |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
|     1SG      |     s(ə)-      |     s(ə)-/z-        |
|     2SG.M    |     w(ə)-      |     w(ə)-           |
|     2SG.F    |     b(ə)-      |     b(ə)-/p-        |
|     3SG.M    |     d(ə)-      |     j(ə)-           |
|     3SG.F    |     d(ə)-      |     l(ə)-           |
|     3SG.N    |     j(ə)-/Ø    |     na-/a-          |
|     1PL      |     h(ə)-      |     h(ə)-/ʕ-        |
|     2PL      |     ŝ(ə)-      |     ŝ(ə)-/ẑ-        |
|     3PL      |     j(ə)-/Ø    |     r(ə)-/d(ə)-     |

Linear position of indexes is even more important for distinguishing between the verb’s arguments than the shape of indexes. Absolutive indexes always occupy the leftmost slot in the verb. Ergative indexes, if present, are always the rightmost indexes in the verb. 3PL and non-human 3SG absolutive indexes can be zero-realized (see Table 1) if the relevant argument is expressed as a full noun phrase in the immediately pre-verbal position (the neutral word order is S(O)V). Both (1) and (2) are examples of the basic transitive construction.

```

(1) fatíma  murád  də-l-də́r-əj-d
    PN      PN     3SG.H.ABS-3SG.F.ERG-know-PRS-DCL
    ‘Fatima knows Murad.’

(2) á-č’ḳʷən  a-bánka  ʕa-qə-j-ṭə́-d
    DEF-boy   DEF-jar  CISL-LOC-3SG.M.ERG-open-DCL
    ‘The boy opened the jar.’

```

Indexing of non-core arguments is normally associated with applicative preverbs, including benefactive (*z-*), comitative (*c-*), malefactive (*ĉ-*) and a large number of locative preverbs. These indexes always immediately precede their respective preverbs. In (3), the second argument (‘Fatima’) is associated with the benefactive preverb and is indexed in the slot immediately preceding the benefactive preverb (the valency pattern of this verb can be represented as ABS_BEN).

```

(3) murad  fatima  d-lə-z-qʷə́c-əj-ṭ
    PN     PN      3SG.H.ABS-3SG.F.IO-BEN-think-PRS-DCL
    ‘Murad is thinking about Fatima.’

```

In some cases, indirect objects are not associated with an overt preverb and can be formally indistinguishable from ergative arguments, as in (4). 

```

(4) fatíma  á-psthʷa-kʷa  də-r-pš-ə́j-ṭ
    PN      DEF-cloud-PL  3SG.H.ABS-3PL.IO-look-PRS-DCL
    ‘Fatima is looking at the clouds.’

```

All locative preverbs are invariably glossed “LOC”, but the actual shape of the specific applicative preverb is indicated (in a simplified form) in the valency pattern label, e.g., the valency pattern of the verb in (5) is represented as “ABS_LOCpca”, because the second argument is associated with the locative preverb *p.č̣a*.

```

(5) rasúl murád d-ʕa-j-p.č̣a-ŝá-ṭ
    PN PN 3SG.H.ABS-CISL-3SG.M.IO-LOC-fall(AOR)-DCL
    ‘Rasul ran into Murad.’

```

The linear order of verb prefixes, including applicative preverbs and their respective indexes, is fixed.

### Case system
There is no grammatical case on nouns. The only nominal dependent marker found in the data is the instrumental *-la*.

## Verb lemmas
Verbs are quoted in the form of roots in combination with all preverbs that are relevant for the expression of the relevant lexical meaning. Thus, ‘to know’ from (1) is quoted as *dər*, and ‘to open’ from (2), as *qə-ṭə*. If a certain preverb is used as an applicative marker associated with a slot for indexing one of the two pre-defined arguments (X or Y), this preverb is shown in square brackets, e.g. ‘to think’ from (3) is quoted as *[z-]qʷəc*.
