## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction
Kpelle is a tonal language featuring two basic tones, low and high, organised into word-level melodies. Tones also function as grammatical markers, e.g. on nominal heads of complex words and on verbs in some TAMP constructions. Both lexical and grammatical tones are further modified by phonological rules. In the examples below, surface tones are marked.  

The basic word order is (S) AUX (O) V X, where S stands for the subject, V is the verb, AUX is an auxiliary expressing subject person-number as well as TAMP values, O is the direct object, X is the indirect object or adjunct, most often encoded by a postpositional phrase or a locative expression. 

```
(1)  Pépèe  àa       ɓɛ́laa  tɛ́ɣɛ  Hɛ́ni  pɔ́
     PN     3SG.PRF  sheep  give  PN    to
     ‘Pepee gave a sheep to Heni’.
```

Lexical subject is optional; its person-number features are indexed by the auxiliary.
 
```
(2a)  Pépèe  àá       kwɛ̀ni  píli
      PN     3SG.PRF  stone  throw
      ‘Pepee threw a stone’.

(2b)  àá      kwɛ̀ni  píli
      3SG.PRF stone  throw
      ‘(S)he threw a stone’.
```

Verbs lacking a direct object are intransitive. The word order in possessive NPs is possessor - possessee. Adjectives are limited in Kpelle, and lexical adnominal modifiers are typically expressed by verbs in a stative form following the head noun.
 
### Case system
There is no morphological case on nouns, although locative forms of some nouns can be viewed as peripheral case forms, e.g. *pɛ́lɛ* ‘house’ vs. *pɛ́lɛ́ŋ̀* ‘in the house’, *tǎa* 'village' vs. *tàáì* 'in the village'.

## Verb lemmas
