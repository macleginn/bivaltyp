## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

Tsudakhar Dargwa follows an ergative-absolutive alignment, typical of all languages of this family, with feature agreement based on nominal class (gender/number) and person agreement, as is common in Dargwa languages. This system allows for free word order. It is a highly agglutinative language in both nominal and verbal domains, featuring an extensive and complex case system, particularly in the locative domain.

### Case system

The grammatical cases include the nominative (NOM), which is unmarked and corresponds to the base form of the word, along with the ergative (ERG), genitive (GEN), dative (DAT), and comitative (COM) cases. 

The system of spatial cases is structured around three dimensions: localisation, orientation, and direction. The locative morphemes in Tsudakhar Dargwa specify spatial relations relative to the marked noun. The system of spatial cases is shown in Table 1.

|              |     LAT     |     ESS        |     ABL1        |     ABL2                |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------------|

|     LOC      |     -le     |     -le-CM     |     -le-la      |     -le-kar/-kanra      |
|     INTER    |     -ce     |     -ce-CM     |     -c:e-la     |     -ce-kar/-kanra      |
|     APUD     |     -šːu    |     -šːu-CM    |     -šːu-la     |     -šːu-kar /-kanra    |
|     ANTE     |     -sa     |     -sa-CM     |     -sa-la      |     -sa-kar /-kanra     |

When no orientation or direction morphemes are added, locative markers indicate movement towards a location (lative meaning). Combining a locative morpheme with an agreement marker indexing the gender and number of the nominative argument (subject of an intransitive verb or object of a transitive verb) results in an essive orientation, expressing a static position in space.

Additionally, two ablative strategies exist: ABL1 conveys locative ablative meaning, while ABL2 signifies a more non-locative ablative function. Finally, the ergative case is formally expressed by the LOC localisation without further orientation/direction marker, so that the combined gloss ERG/LOC(LAT) is used below in the data.

## Verb lemmas

Verbs are cited in their infinitive forms, with aspectual pairs presented in the order PFV/IPFV. Verbs that include a gender and number agreement marker are presented with the singular neuter class marker b- for reference. In complex verbal predicates, the non-verbal component is separated from the auxiliary verb and appears before the first (PFV) verbal root. If the verb contains a locative prefix or prefixes, they are indicated with a hyphen.
