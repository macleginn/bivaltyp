## Grammar notes

Irish is a strict VSO language, with the word order being the main indicator of syntactic roles in transitive constructions as nouns do not inflect for case and there is no verbal agreement. E.g., 

```
(1) Do=chaith Pól cloch.
    PST=throw PN  stone
    ‘Pól threw a stone.’
```

Munster Irish has preserved more synthetic verb forms than other dialects, but these forms are not compatible with nominal arguments (cf. _molaid_ ‘they praise’ [Munster] vs. _molann siad_ ‘id.’ [standard] vs. _molann marcaigh_ ‘horsemen praise’ [both]).

The transitive construction can be changed into an intransitive one by adding a preposition to the oblique argument:

```
(2) Creid-eann  Pól i  Mícheal.
    believe-PRS PN  in PN
    ‘Pól believes Mícheal.’

(3) Do=bhuail Pól le   Mícheal.
    PST=meet  pn  with PN
    ‘Pól encountered Mícheal.’
```

In the progressive construction often used by the consultants, the main predicate is represented by a nominalization, which takes the direct object in the genitive case and obliques in the same PP form as finite verbs:

```
(4) Tá     Pól aig tiomáint   an     bhó.
    be.PRS PN  at  drive.NMLZ DEF.GS cow(GS)
    ‘Pól is driving the cow.’
    
(5) Tá     Pól ag bruíon      le   Máire.
    be.PRS PN  at fight.NMLZ  with PN
    ‘Pól is fighting with Máire.’
```

Irish lacks the verb ‘have’, whose meaning is expressed via the construction ‘There is POSSESSUM at POSSESSOR’. The possessive construction can also be used to express some other meanings:

```
(6) Tá     gluaisteán aige Pól.
    be.PRS car        at   PN
    ‘Pól has a car.’

(7) Tá     aithne    aige Pól air Mháire.
    be.PRS knowledge at   PN  on  PN
    ‘Pól knows Máire.’
```

Some experiential predicates are expressed by means of a similar constructions ‘There is X on SUBJ’, where X is a nominally expressed predicate. E.g.,

```
(8) Tá     slaghdán air Phól.
    be.PRS flu      on  PN
    ‘Pól has the flu.’

(9) Tá     eagla air Phól roimh        an  gadhar.
    be.PRS fear  on  PN   in.front.of  DEF dog
    ‘Pól is afraid of the dog.’
```

Some predicates employ other prepositions instead of _air_, e.g., _ó_ ‘from’.

Two other recurrent patterns are the use of a copula+adjective combination to express attitudes (10-11) and the use of light verbs ‘give’, ‘put’, and ‘do’ with a nominal object for a wide variety of meanings (12-14).

```
(10) Is      breá     le   Pól tae.
     COP.PRS pleasant with PN  tea
     ‘Pól loves tea.’

(11) Is      maith le   Pól an  léine sea
     COP.PRS good  with PN  DEF shirt DEM
     ‘Pól likes this shirt.’

(12) Do=rug        madra greim   ar Phól.
     PST=take/give dog   seizure on PN
     ‘A dog bit Pól.’

(13) Chuir   Pól piniós     air a           mhac.
     PST/put PN  punishment on  POSS.3SG.M  son
     ‘Pól punished his son.’

(14) Dhein    Pól dearúd   air an  mbóthar eile.
     PST/make PN  oblivion on  def road    other
     ‘Pól forgot (about) the other road.’
```
