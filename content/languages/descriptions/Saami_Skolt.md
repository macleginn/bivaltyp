Skolt Saami is an endangered Finno-Ugric language spoken primarily in the Municipality of Inari, in the northeast of Finland, by less than 300 people. The data presented here were collected from a speaker living in the village of Sevettijärvi, the main cultural hub of Skolt Saami life. In addition, around 20 Skolt Saami speakers live in Russia, on the Kola Peninsula.

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction
Case marking displays the nominative-accusative alignment. In the basic transitive construction, the subject (A- or S-argument) is in the nominative, and the object (P-argument) is in the accusative. Similarly to most other Saami languages (and unlike South Saami), Skolt Saami does not show any differential object marking. The verb agrees with the nominative argument in person and number. The neutral word order is SV(O). An example of the transitive construction can be found in (1).

```
(1) Peâtt      laaʹpp-i      lokkčouddj-id
    PN.SG.NOM  lose-PST.3SG  key-PL.ACC
    ‘Pete lost the keys.’
```

Non-core arguments are typically flagged by oblique cases or by postpositions, which require genitive marking on the noun. For a comprehensive description of Skolt Saami, see Feist (2015).
