## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

French displays the nominative-accusative alignment. Nominal core arguments (A, S and O) remain unflagged, so that the distinction between subject and direct object is only indicated by word order (SVO). By contrast, personal pronouns (clitics) distinguish 2 or 3 case forms (depending on the person); besides, with pronominal direct objects,  word order is SOV. The two variants of the transitive construction are given in (1) and (2). 

```
(1) Paul   respecte         Marie
    PN(M)  respect.PRS.3SG  PN(F)
    ‘Paul respects Marie.’

(2) Paul   la       respecte
    PN(M)  she.ACC  respect.PRS.3SG
    ‘Paul respects her.’

```

Nominal arguments other than A, S and O are flagged by prepositions. Subjects (A and S) are indexed on the verbs. In some contexts, participles in analytic constructions also signal the gender (orthographically, also the number) of the direct object. 

### Case system

French has no morphological case on nouns. Personal pronouns has three case-marked clitic forms: nominative, accusative and dative. The dative form of a pronoun usually corresponds to the combination of the preposition *à* with the noun, see (3) and (4).

```
(3)  Paul   a             répondu            à   ses       parent-s
     PN(M)  have.PRS.3SG  answer.PST.PTCP.M  to  one’s.PL  parent(M)-PL
     ‘Paul answered his parents.’

(4)  Paul   leur      a             répondu
     PN(M)  they.DAT  have.PRS.3SG  answer.PST.PTCP.M
     ‘Paul answered them.’
```

The encoding of the Y argument in structures like (3) and (4) is treated as "Non-direct object" (labelled as NDIR.OBJ in valency class tags). However, combinations of the same preposition *à* with the noun can correspond to two further encoding possibilities for pronominal arguments. With some verbs, pronouns are introduced by the same preposition *à*. Such encoding patterns are tagged as simply "a" in valency class tags (see entry 25 in the dataset below). With still other verbs, the pronominal equivalent is *y* ‘there’. Such encoding patterns are tagged as "a(LOC)" (see entries 1 and 81 in the dataset below). Apart from pronominal clitics, there are stressed pronouns that are used in a number of syntactic environments, including combinations with prepositions.
