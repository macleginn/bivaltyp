## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

French displays the nominative-accusative alignment. Nominal core arguments (A, S and O) remain unflagged, so that the distinction between subject and direct object is only indicated by word order (SVO). By contrast, personal pronouns (clitics) distinguish 2 or 3 case forms (depending on the person) and word order is SOV. The two variants of the transitive construction are given in (1) and (2). 

```
(1) Paul   respecte         Marie
    PN(M)  respect.PRS.3SG  PN(F)
    ‘Paul respects Marie.’

(2) Paul   le       respecte
    PN(M)  she.ACC  respect.PRS.3SG
    ‘Paul respects her.’

```

Nominal arguments other than A, S and O are flagged by prepositions. Prepositions used in non-transitive constructions are used for the identification of valency classes in the dataset below. Subjects (A and S) are indexed on the verbs.

### Case system

French has no morphological case on nouns. Personal pronouns has three case-marked clitic forms: nominative, accusative and dative. The dative form usually corresponds to the combination of the preposition *à* with the noun (although some discrepancies are possible), see (3) and (4).

```
(3)  Paul   a             répondu            à   ses       parent-s
     PN(M)  have.PRS.3SG  answer.PST.PTCP.M  to  one’s.PL  parent(M)-PL
     ‘Paul answered his parents.’

(4)  Paul   leur      a             répondu
     PN(M)  they.DAT  have.PRS.3SG  answer.PST.PTCP.M
     ‘Paul answered them.’
```

Apart from pronominal clitics, there are stressed pronouns that are used in a number of syntactic environments, including combinations with prepositions.
