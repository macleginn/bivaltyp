## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

In Uzbek, the default linear pattern is SOV. In the transitive construction, nominal subjects are used in the unmarked form and direct objects are used either in the unmarked form (1) or in the accusative case (2) depending on their animacy and referentiality (Differential Object Marking).

```

(1)  Petya  toš    ot-ti
     Petya  stone  throw-PST.3SSG
     ‘Petya threw a stone.’

(2)  Petya  itt-i-n           qo’rqi-yab-ti
     Petya  dog-POSS.3SG-ACC  be_afraid-PRS1-3SG
     ‘Petya is afraid of the dog.’

```

The predicate agrees with the subject in person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and number (singular, plural). Non-core arguments are flagged by oblique cases or by postpositions. The verbal tenses in the examples include the first present (marked with *-yab*), the second present (marked with *-a*, *-y*), the third present (marked with *-moqda*), the fourth present (marked with *-ib*), the past (*-di*) or the perfect (*-gan*).

### Case system
The case system includes six cases for nouns, viz. the unmarked nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, and ablative, as exemplified for the noun bala ‘child’ in Table 1.
