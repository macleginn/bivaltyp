The data were initially gathered in 2018 and then some changes have been made in 2024. The Russian version of the questionnaire was used for elicitation.

Mehweb, a divergent lect of Northern Dargwa, is spoken in one village in Gunib district by less than 1,000 people, as well as by an unknown number of people living outside the village. Mehwebs are surrounded by Lak and Avar villages and have traditionally shown a high degree of multilingualism in both languages. 

## Grammar notes

### Basic clause structure and the transitive construction

In terms of both case marking and gender agreement in the clause, Mehweb shows ergative patterning; the canonical transitive construction is observed in, e.g. (4). The ergative patterning is quite often obscured by the binominative construction involving the converb of the lexical verb and the auxiliary, as in (43). Here, the agreement on the converb is controlled by the P-argument (like in the canonical transitive construction in (4)); the agreement on the auxiliary is controlled by the A-argument (unlike in the canonical transitive construction in (4)); and both arguments are in the nominative. Mehweb also has a very productive morphological causative suffix, as in (44), a relatively limited number of labile verbs and two lexicalized unmarked anticausative derivations ('bring' and 'fetch'). Neither labile verbs not anticausative constructions are present in the dataset.

### Case system

Mehweb has the nominal inflection design typical of the East Caucasian (cf. the other contributions to this database). It includes two largely independent paradigms - cases (alias syntactic cases, grammatical cases) and spatial forms (alias spatial cases, locative cases). Mehweb has four (grammatical) cases: Nominative (unmarked), Ergative, Genitive, Dative and Comitative, and three additional marginal forms including Causal 'because of X', Substitutive 'instead of X, on X's behalf', and Replicative 'in the way X does this' (these forms do not appear in the dataset). Spatial forms are morphologically complex, involving one marker for spatial relation (traditionally called "localization") and one marker for directionality (traditionally called "orientation"). 

There are five markers for spatial relations: i) location on the upper surface of a landmark (‘on the table’, glossed as SUPER), ii) inside a hollow landmark (‘in the box’, glossed as IN), iii) inside a mass (‘in the water’) or among a set of landmarks (‘among the trees'), also expressing fixed position on any surface (‘carpet on the wall’), all three functions glossed as INTER, iv) near a landmark (as in ‘at my parents’ place’, glossed as AD); and in the proximity of a landmark (‘by the wall’, glossed as APUD). Only CONT, SUPER, AD and IN are present in the dataset, with IN only present in purely spatial contexts, such as (12) and (14). 

There are five values of directionality:  essive (Place), lative (Goal), elative (Source), translative (Path) and directive (Direction). Essive and lative are only differentiated by the presence of agreement slot in essive forms (the agreement is controlled by the clausal nominative). Apart from the elative in *-la*, there are several additional elative markers, but their distribution is unclear. Only elative, lative and essive are attested in the dataset, and of all elative markers only the “basic” elative in *-la*. Mehweb also has a large number of non-bound functional elements that show mixed properties of adverb and adpositions; of all these items, only three are present in the dataset as means of flagging (i.e. postnominally), each only once.  

## Verb lemmas

In Mehweb, as generally in Dargwa, most verbs have two very distinct stems used in perfective and imperfective forms; patterns of their formal relation are many and complex. Citation forms provided in the dataset are  perfective infinitives, even if the form used in the example is imperfective. Whenever the perfective stem is absent, we provide the imperfective stem, as in (1); when the intended meaning is normally rendered with a resultative form, this form (combination of the perfective converb with the auxiliary) is given, as in (2). With non-verbal predicates (e.g. in 24 or 25), or for complex predicates (e.g. 19), the respective construction is given as the verbal lemma.
